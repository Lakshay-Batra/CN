network is a powerful data modeling tool that is able to capture and represent 
complex input/output relationships. The motivation for the development of neural 
network technology stemmed from the desire to develop an artificial system that 
could perform "intelligent" tasks similar to those performed by the human brain. 
Neural networks resemble the human brain in the following two ways:

<P align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>The true power and advantage of 
neural networks lies in their ability to represent both linear and non-linear 
relationships and in their ability to learn these relationships directly from 
the data being modeled. Traditional linear models are simply inadequate when it 
comes to modeling data that contains non-linear characteristics. 
</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>The most common neural network 
model is the multilayer perception (MLP). This type of neural network is known 
as a supervised network because it requires a desired output in order to learn. 
The goal of this type of network is to create a model that correctly maps the 
input to the output using historical data so that the model can then be used to 
produce the output when the desired output is unknown. A graphical 
representation of an MLP is shown below. </FONT></SPAN></P>

As the processed data leaves the first hidden layer, again it gets multiplied by 
interconnection weights, then summed and processed by the second hidden layer.

<P align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>The MLP and many other neural

propagation, the input data is repeatedly presented to the neural network. With 
each presentation the output of the neural network is compared to the desired 
output and an error is computed. This error is then fed back (back propagated) 
to the neural network and used to adjust the weights such that the error 
decreases with each iteration and the neural model gets closer and closer to 
producing the desired output. This process is known as "training".

a printed document and then convert the scanned image into to an electronic text 
format such as a Word document, enabling you to manipulate the text. In order to 
perform this conversion the software must analyze each group of pixels (0's and 
1's) that form a letter and produce a value that corresponds to that letter. 
Some of the OCR software on the market use a neural network as the 
classification engine. </FONT></SPAN></P>

style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3> </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>Sol:- Genetic algorithms are 
general-purpose search algorithms based upon the principles of evolution 
observed in nature. Even with today's high-powered computers, using an 
exhaustive search to find the optimal solution for even relatively small 
problems can be prohibitively expensive. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>For many problems, genetic 
algorithms can often find good solutions (near-optimal) in around 100 
generations. This can be many times faster than an exhaustive search. For 
example, a chromosome containing 32 binary genes would have 4,294,967,296 
possible combinations (solutions) to evaluate when using an exhaustive search. 
If the same problem were to be solved with a genetic algorithm of population 
size 50, requiring 100 generations of evolution, the genetic algorithm would 
only need to evaluate 5000 possible solutions. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>As mentioned previously, 
genetic algorithms are able to find optimal or near optimal solutions by using 
many of the principles of evolution that can be observed in nature. These 
include selection, crossover, and mutation. Below is an outline of how a genetic 
algorithm uses these principals to search for optimal solutions: 
</FONT></SPAN></P>
<OL style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in" type=1>
  <LI class=MsoNormal>
  <p align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>Create an 
  initial population of chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of a collection 
  of genes (the parameters to be optimized) and represents a complete solution 
  to the problem at hand. The gene values are usually initialized to random 
  values within user-specified boundaries. </FONT></SPAN>
  <LI class=MsoNormal>
  <p align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>Evaluate 
  each of the chromosomes in the initial population. A chromosome is evaluated 
  by a fitness function to determine the quality of the solution. This fitness 
  function is problem-specific and defines the genetic algorithm's objective for 
  the current problem. </FONT></SPAN>
  <LI class=MsoNormal>
  <p align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>Select 
  chromosomes that will have their information passed on to the next generation. 
  The most common selection operator is “roulette selection”. This selection 
  operator is based upon the evolutionary principle know as “survival of the 
  fittest”, whereby a chromosome's probability of getting selected is 
  proportional to its fitness. Thus, the good solutions are more likely to 
  survive. </FONT></SPAN>
  <LI class=MsoNormal>
  <p align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>Crossover 
  the selected chromosomes to produce new offspring chromosomes. This crossover 
  occurs according to some user-defined probability (usually high) and results 
  in new chromosomes having characteristics taken from both of the parent 
  chromosomes. The most common crossover operator is “one point crossover”. This 
  crossover operator picks a random point within the chromosomes, then switches 
  the genes of the two chromosomes at this point to produce two new offspring. 
  If an offspring takes the best parts from each of its parents, the result will 
  likely be a better solution. </FONT></SPAN>
  <LI class=MsoNormal>
  <p align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>Mutate the 
  genes of the offspring chromosomes. This mutation occurs according to some 
  user-defined probability (usually low) and serves to introduce some 
  variability into the gene pool. Without mutation, offspring chromosomes would 
  be limited to only the genes available within the initial population. For real 
  genes, one of the most common mutation operators simply adds a Gaussian 
  distributed random value to the gene being mutated. </FONT></SPAN>
  <LI class=MsoNormal>
  <p align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>Repeat steps 
  3 through 5 until a new population of chromosomes has been created. Two 
  chromosomes are selected, crossed-over, and mutated to produce two offspring 
  until there are enough offspring to fill a population the same size as the 
  last population. </FONT></SPAN>
  <LI class=MsoNormal>
  <p align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>Evaluate 
  each of the chromosomes in the new population. Each of the chromosomes in the 
  current population is evaluated by the fitness function, just as the initial 
  population was evaluated in step 2. </FONT></SPAN>
  <LI class=MsoNormal>
  <p align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>Repeat steps 
  3 through 7 until some termination condition has been met. This termination 
  condition can be based simply on the number of generations or it can be based 
  upon more complex criteria such as the population convergence, fitness 
  convergence, etc. </FONT></SPAN></LI></OL>
<P align="justify"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT size=3>After the evolution of the 
initial population through many generations, the chromosomes (or solutions) 
within the final population will generally be much better as a whole than the 
chromosomes within the initial population. Also, the best chromosome in the 
final population will generally be near optimal if the genetic algorithm was run 
for enough generations. </FONT></SPAN></P>

neural network, optimize the neural network parameters (such as the learning 
rates, number of hidden layer processing elements, etc.), train the actual 
network weights (rather than using back propagation), or to choose/modify the
