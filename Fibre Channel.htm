</b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">At the physical layer, Fibre Channel is 
frame based. Each frame has a 2KB payload and is protected with a 32-bit CRC. 
Flow control is credit based. There is never a fear of collision-a packet simply 
waits until it receives permission to transmit. This flow mechanism maintains 
maximum throughput even during peak loads. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Different levels of reliability are 
available depending on the class of service requested by the application. Class 
1 service provides classic, dedicated, connection based service. It guarantees 
reliable delivery. More common is Class 2 service, which is connectionless and 
provides guaranteed delivery with an acknowledgement of receipt. Class 3 service 
is connectionless without delivery acknowledgement. Classes are available for 
fractional bandwidth, unidirectional or multicast services. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The specifications for Fibre Channel 
define a variety of physical topologies: point-to-point, loop and switched.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Point-to-point offers dedicated bandwidth 
between the connected systems. Data may flow directly between two connected 
endpoints, or multiple devices may share a switch that is dynamically configured 
for several point-to-point configurations. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A loop topology shares bandwidth with 
devices attached in a loop configuration. Up to 128 nodes may reside on a loop.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The switched topology resembles telephone 
service-the node provides the desired address and the switch is responsible for 
making the connection. One switch, or a &quot;fabric&quot; of switches, appears to the 
node as a single entity. As switches are added or removed, the fabric is 
responsible for its own reconfiguration. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fibre channel nodes perform a login 
process to establish a connection with the appropriate class of service. Login 
also determines what is attached to the other end of the point-to-point 
link-whether it is another node, a loop or a switch-and communicates with it 
appropriately. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fibre channel provides a transport layer 
above which any of a variety of protocols may exists. The transport layer 
provides for common services, which are available to all nodes. These services 
include a name server (address database), an alias server (for multicasting), a 
timeserver and others. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Protocols traditionally thought of as 
either channel or network may co-exist on a single Fibre Channel physical layer. 
The lower Fibre Channel transport layers are not cognizant of the &quot;ULP&quot; (Upper 
Layer Protocol). Many ULPs have been specified or are in the process of 
specification. These include SCSI, IP, HiPPI and ESCON. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fibre Channel combines high performance 
with flexibility in class of service, physical topology and protocol layering.</font></p>
<p class="General4" align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Protocol Analysis </font>
</b>
</p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fibre Channel is rich in 
capability and complexity. The trend towards heterogeneous storage area networks 
makes testing all the more critical. The difficulty of the validation task is 
further burdened by Fibre Channel's high data rate and the many reliability 
features inherent in it's design. Simply identifying the presence of errors is 
often masked by built-in error recovery features and redundancy at the ordered 
set level. </font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">LeCroy's family of storage 
analysis products combine a powerful triggering and decoding engine with an easy 
to use graphical interface that removes complexity and trains the eye to 
understand more information faster. The intuitive use of color and the logical 
grouping of Sequence and Exchange events help communicate the meaning of fibre 
channel traffic. The LeCroy <i>Tracer</i> software detects and alerts the user 
to problems at all functional levels of the Fibre Channel layering including:
</font></p>
<ul class="bodytxt">
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>FC-1</b>: Invalid CRC; running 
  disparity error, invalid 10bit codes </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>FC-2</b>: frame, sequence and 
  exchange violations </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>FC-4</b>: FCP mapping and SCSI errors
  </font></li>
</ul>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The data rate generated by 
2Gbps fibre channel can exceed 400MB per second (full duplex). This underscores 
the importance of filtering to isolate the most important traffic. Excluding 
channels from the recording and truncating the data portion of the payload are 
frequently used to preserve memory. But FC<i>Tracer</i> goes well beyond these 
typical strategies with context sensitive filtering. </font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">FC<i>Tracer</i>'s 
filtering engine leverages LeCroy's new sequencer capable of monitoring two 
unrelated series of events in parallel. It can filter different fields based on 
traffic detected on the link. This powerful triggering and filtering model is 
particularly useful for trapping intermittent problems on live SANs. </font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The FC<i>Tracer</i> 
protocol analyzer offers special features for system level validation. It 
combines real-time monitoring with extensive performance metrics that provide 
visual and statistical information about the nature of the Fibre Channel 
traffic. These summary reports allow FC<i>Tracer</i> to automatically track SCSI 
Command completion rates over extended periods allowing users to identify errant 
or overloaded devices. </font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fibre Channel's complexity 
requires advanced testing capability. By selecting tools appropriate to the 
task, engineers can minimize the learning curve and reduce time to market for 
Fibre Channel products. </font></p>

Channel Technology</font></p>
<p class="General4" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fibre Channel Overview
</font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fibre Channel is a 
networking standard that is designed to move data through specific devices at 
specific speeds. Initially, Fibre Channel was used primarily to attach servers 
to a storage device, such as a RAID array or a tape backup device. More 
recently, Fibre Channel has evolved as the architecture of choice for many 
storage area networks. Fibre Channel is ideally suited to this role because it 
is very reliable, very scalable, and very flexible. It's possible to add more 
storage without disrupting operations, use a number of backup schemes that don't 
load the main network, and manage very large data collections that span multiple 
disks.</font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fibre Channel is a high 
speed (100 to 800 Mbps) medium used for data transfer and storage. Fibre Channel 
provides a logical bi-directional, point-to-point connection between a host and 
a device. It is essentially a serial data channel created over fiber optic 
cabling which makes it possible to transfer data at much greater distances than 
SCSI and ATA interfaces.</font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fibre Channel is designed 
to work with either copper wires or with fiber. Although copper is used only for 
shorter distances, a variety of copper mediums can be used, including telephone 
wire or coaxial cable. If fiber optic cable is used, distances of about six 
miles can be achieved with minimal loss of speed. Another advantage of dedicated 
channel based communication is its ability to provide increased bandwidth than 
network based links.</font></p>
<p class="General4" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Features and Benefits
</font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Storage Area Networks are 
not new ideas in data storage, however they are increasing in popularity due to 
high demand by users who need to store large volumes of data. A SAN is a group 
of storage devices connected via a network of connections to host computer or 
server. The primary advantages of SANs are: </font></p>
<ul class="bodytxt">
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Storage resource pooling/sharing </font>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">LAN and server-free backup </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Centralized storage resource management
  </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Data sharing - Large number of users
  </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Performance - High Speed, Low Latency
  </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Distance (&gt;10KM) </font></li>
</ul>
<p class="General4" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Architecture </font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Channels and networks are 
the two primary ways that data is transferred between devices. Fibre Channel 
uses channels and frames instead of packets to move data. Each frame is 
approximately 2KB in size. Of this amount, 1.5 percent is header information. 
Channels transfer data through switched or direct point-to-point connections and 
they work by creating a fixed connection between the source and destination 
devices until the transfer is complete. </font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Connections are made on 
Fibre Channel systems through &quot;interconnection components&quot; including switches, 
hubs, and bridges. The ability of Fibre Channel to use different interconnect 
devices makes it scalable depending on user needs. For small Fibre Channel 
networks, hubs and bridges may be used for connecting devices in a topology 
called Fiber Channel arbitrated Loop (FC- AL). As Fibre Channel networks get 
larger and network demands increase, switching may be implemented. A switched 
Fibre Channel network is called a fabric. </font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fabric topology permits 
multiple paths between two ports on the Fabric. Loop topology, on the other 
hand, there can only be one active circuit at a time. Loop and Fabric topologies 
can be combined to provide both connectivity and performance. If a link in a 
point-to-point topology fails, communication between that pair of ports stops. 
Communication between other point-to-point connected Ports continues. </font>
</p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fiber optics are excellent 
for transmitting data across a network because they are reliable. They do not 
have the same problems that are associated with copper cabling such as 
attenuation (loss of signal strength) and noise. It is also more secure than 
copper because crosstalk does not occur with Fiber Optic cables. Fibre Channel 
traffic can also be transmitted over other cable types such as copper, coaxial 
cables or Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) wires. </font></p>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Class of Service - Fibre 
Channel technology makes use of classes of service to define communication 
between devices. </font></p>
<ul class="bodytxt">
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Class 1</b> a dedicated channel 
  between two connection devices. In this configuration, if a host and a device 
  are connected, no other host can use that connection. The advantage of using 
  service class 1 is speed and reliability. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Class 2</b> is known as a 
  &quot;connectionless&quot; service. It a frame-switched link that guarantees delivery of 
  packets from device to device and packet receipt acknowledgments. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Class 3</b> is called unacknowledged 
  connectionless service and is good for broadcasts. This configuration allows 
  multiple transmissions to be sent across the Fibre Channel fabric to multiple 
  devices. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Class 4</b> is called &quot;intermix&quot;, 
  which creates a dedicated connection but it also allows class 2 traffic to 
  access the link. This method is very efficient and it allows for greater 
  bandwidth because more than one connection can access the system at any time.
  </font></li>
</ul>
<p class="bodytxt" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Fibre Channel 
architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. The layers in the table represent 
different functions that exists within a Fibre channel system. As with the other 
communcation standards, protocol level analysis is often focused at the link 
layer (FC-2) and above. </font></p>
