<font size="6" color="#FF0000">NNTP Protocol</font></span></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The <em>Network News Transfer Protocol 
(NNTP)</em> is documented in RFC 977. NNTP is a request-reply protocol in the 
style of SMTP or FTP. Unlike mail, news does not require separate protocols for 
user-to-host and host-to-host exchanges. NNTP is used in all cases. NNTP has 
facilities to support reading newsgroups, posting new articles, and transferring 
articles between news servers.</font></p>
<font color="#000000" face="Arial">
<p align="justify">The NNTP protocol is the delivery mechanism for the USENET 
newsgroup service. USENET runs on the Internet and other TCP/IP-based networks 
and provides a way to exchange messages, articles, and bulletins throughout the 
Internet. Articles are put in central databases throughout the Internet and 
users access the database to get the articles they need. This reduces network 
traffic and eliminates the need to store a copy of each article on every 
subscriber's system.</p>
<p align="justify">There are thousands of different newsgroups related to 
computers, social issues, science, the humanities, recreation, and other topics. 
See &quot;USENET&quot; for more information on USENET itself. This topic discusses the 
operation of the NNTP protocol.</p>
<p align="justify">USENET servers use NNTP to exchange news articles among 
themselves. NNTP is also used by clients who need to read news articles on 
USENET servers. The server-to-server and user-to-server connections are 
described here:</p>
<ul>
  <b>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Server-to-server exchanges</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the server-to-server 
  exchange, one server either requests the latest articles from another server (<i>pull</i>) 
  or allows the other server to <i>push</i> new articles to it. In either case, 
  both servers engage in a conversation in which specific newsgroup information 
  is requested and then delivered. A primary goal is to prevent the sending 
  system from sending articles that the receiver already has. Select newsgroups 
  and articles can be blocked.<br>
&nbsp;</font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="2"></li>
  </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">
  <li>
  <p align="justify">User-to-server connections</font></b><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Users run news readers, which are now included with most Web browsers. The 
  user first connects with a newsgroup server (usually located at an ISP 
  (Internet service provider), then downloads a list of available newsgroups. 
  The user can then subscribe to a newsgroup and begin reading articles 
  available in that group or post new articles.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">Before NNCP, USENET servers used UUCP (UNIX-to-UNIX Copy 
Program) to exchange information. UUCP is a &quot;flood broadcast&quot; mechanism. Hosts 
send new news articles they receive to other hosts, which in turn forward the 
news on to other hosts that they feed. Usually, a host receives duplicates of 
articles and must discard those duplicates-a time-consuming process and waste of 
bandwidth.</p>
<p align="justify">NNTP uses an interactive command and response mechanism that 
lets hosts determine which articles are to be transmitted. A host acting as a 
client contacts a &quot;server&quot; host using NNTP, and then inquires if any new 
newsgroups have been created on any of the serving host systems. An 
administrator can choose to create similar newsgroups on the host he or she 
manages.</p>
<p align="justify">During the same NNTP session, the client requests information 
about new articles that have arrived in all or some of the newsgroups. The 
server then sends the client a list of new articles and the client can request 
transmission of some or all of those articles. The client can refuse to accept 
articles that it already has.</p>
<p align="justify">Readers interested in the details of NNTP commands and 
responses should read RFC 977 (A Proposed Standard for the Stream-Based 
Transmission of News, February 1986).</p>
<p align="justify">Some organizations may prefer to set up their own USENET 
systems on their TCP/IP-based intranet rather than deploy groupware and 
collaborative applications. If you plan on setting up your own news server, 
refer to &quot;USENET.&quot;</p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">NNTP or Network News 
Transfer Protocol as it is also known, is not a widely known protocol. Typically 
this is a service that is offered by your ISP and also is one that has spawned 
its own industry. Company’s such as Supernews and Easynews have grown out of the 
popularity that are the alt.binaries.* groups. If you are lucky though your ISP 
offers you good NNTP servers to use. What are binary newsgroups though? Well 
simply put, they are just as their name indicates ie: binary newsgroups. By 
binary I mean that you could download pictures, programs, movies, music and so 
on ie: a binary transfer. There is pretty everything you would ever hope to find 
in the binary newsgroups. A fair amount of the stuff there is copyrighted 
material, which should not be downloaded either. Largely due to the wide variety 
of material made available via the binary groups is why they are so popular with 
people. What actually makes up the protocol that is used to access these groups 
and in turn download from them? Well that is what we are going to find out in 
this article!</span></font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span lang="EN">On with the show</span></font></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Well NNTP like almost 
every protocol follows the client/server model and is also an application layer 
protocol, as defined by the OSI Reference Model. The protocol uses TCP as its 
transport protocol and of course the IP protocol for routing purposes. NNTP also 
allows for both the sending and receipt of information. In other words it will 
allow you to post messages to newsgroups, as well as download from them, whether 
that download be an ASCII one or binary in nature. Port 119 is the port 
associated with NNTP servers, which are also commonly known as USENET 
newsgroups. </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Similar in nature as 
mentioned earlier to other application layer protocols, NNTP also has a series 
of status codes, much like HTTP. These status codes are used to convey various 
conditions back to the NNTP client. The various status codes are grouped as seen 
below;</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">1xx – Information message<br>
2xx – Command is ok<br>
3xx – Command is ok, continue<br>
4xx – Command ok, but could not be processed<br>
5xx – Command not processed (normally due to a server side error)</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">These messages are quite 
often seen when you are downloading or uploading material. They will be 
displayed in your NNTP client. One of the most popular clients is
<a href="http://www.shemes.com/index.php?p=download" target="_blank" style="color: #000033; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
Grabit</a>, but there is also NewsBin Pro. NNTP is also a little similar to HTTP 
in that it has some commands which are similar to the GET, POST, and HEAD of 
HTTP for example. The NEXT command in NNTP signifies move on to the “next” 
article in the newsgroup. That command is pretty much straightforward. There is 
also the POST command, which much it implies, is for posting to a newsgroup. 
That post could be a request for a specific TV show episode that you missed of 
your favourite show and lucky for you there is a&nbsp; newsgroup for it. In that case 
you would post a message requesting somebody upload that tv show episode, which 
someone hopefully recorded. A complete list of commands and their function can 
be found
here. You should never be afraid to read the specific RFC for a protocol. 
They are usually quite well written and easy to understand. Besides you really 
need to read them, as they are the definitive source of information when it 
comes to protocols. </span></font></p>
