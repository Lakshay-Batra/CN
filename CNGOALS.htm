<h1 align="center"><u><font color="#FF0000">NETWORK GOALS</font></u></h1>
<p align="justify"><b>NETWORK GOALS:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">The main goal of networking is <b>&quot;Resource sharing&quot;</b>, 
  and it is to make all programs, data and equipment available to anyone on the 
  network with out the regard to the physical location of the resource and the 
  user. </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">A second goal is to provide <b>high reliability</b> by 
  having alternative sources of supply. For example, all files could be 
  replicated on two or three machines, so if one of them is unavailable, the 
  other copies could be available. </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Another goal is <b>saving money.</b> Small computers have a 
  much better price/performance ratio than larger ones. Mainframes are roughly a 
  factor of ten times faster than the fastest single chip microprocessors, but 
  they cost thousand times more. This imbalance has caused many system designers 
  to build systems consisting of powerful personal computers, one per user, with 
  data kept on one or more shared <b>file server</b> machines. This goal leads 
  to networks with many computers located in the same building. Such a network 
  is called a <b>LAN (local area network).</b> </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Another closely related goal is to increase the systems 
  performance as the work load increases by just adding more processors. With 
  central mainframes, when the system is full, it must be replaced by a larger 
  one, usually at great expense and with even greater disruption to the users.
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Computer networks provide a powerful communication medium. 
  A file that was updated/modified on a network, can be seen by the other users 
  on the network immediately. </li>
</ul>
<h2 align="justify"><font size="3">NETWORK APPLICATIONS:</font></h2>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Access to remote programs. </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Access to remote databases. </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Value-added communication facilities. </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">Calling up a distant computer via a network is cheaper than 
calling it directly. The lower rate is possible because in a normal telephone 
call ties up an expensive, dedicated circuit for the duration of the call, 
whereas access via a network ties up long-distance lines only while data are 
actually being transmitted.</p>
