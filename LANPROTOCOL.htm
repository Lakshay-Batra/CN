<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">This chapter introduces the various 
media-access methods, transmission methods, topologies, and devices used in a 
local-area network (LAN). Topics addressed focus on the methods and devices used 
in Ethernet/IEEE 802.3, Token Ring/IEEE 802.5, and Fiber Distributed Data 
Interface (FDDI). Subsequent chapters in Part II, &quot;LAN Protocols,&quot; address 
specific protocols in more detail. Figure 2-1 illustrates the basic layout of 
these three implementations. </font></p>

<h2 class="p_H_Head1"><font face="Arial" size="3">What Is a LAN? </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">A
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">LAN</span> is a high-speed 
data network that covers a relatively small geographic area. It typically 
connects workstations, personal computers, printers, servers, and other devices. 
LANs offer computer users many advantages, including shared access to devices 
and applications, file exchange between connected users, and communication 
between users via electronic mail and other applications. </font></p>
<h2 class="p_H_Head1"><font face="Arial" size="3">LAN Protocols and the OSI Reference 
Model </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">LAN protocols function at the lowest two 
layers of the OSI reference model, as discussed in Chapter 1, &quot;Internetworking 
Basics,&quot; between the physical layer and the data link layer. Figure 2-2 
illustrates how several popular LAN protocols map to the OSI reference model.

Mapped to the OSI Reference Model</font></p>

<h2 class="p_H_Head1"><font face="Arial" size="3">LAN Media-Access Methods </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Media contention occurs when two or more 
network devices have data to send at the same time. Because multiple devices 
cannot talk on the network simultaneously, some type of method must be used to 
allow one device access to the network media at a time. This is done in two main 
ways: carrier sense multiple access collision detect (CSMA/CD) and token 
passing. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">In networks using
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">CSMA/CD</span> technology 
such as Ethernet, network devices contend for the network media. When a device 
has data to send, it first listens to see if any other device is currently using 
the network. If not, it starts sending its data. After finishing its 
transmission, it listens again to see if a collision occurred. A collision 
occurs when two devices send data simultaneously. When a collision happens, each 
device waits a random length of time before resending its data. In most cases, a 
collision will not occur again between the two devices. Because of this type of 
network contention, the busier a network becomes, the more collisions occur. 
This is why performance of Ethernet degrades rapidly as the number of devices on 
a single network increases. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">In<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic"> 
token-passing</span> networks such as Token Ring and FDDI, a special network 
frame called a token is passed around the network from device to device. When a 
device has data to send, it must wait until it has the token and then sends its 
data. When the data transmission is complete, the token is released so that 
other devices may use the network media. The main advantage of token-passing 
networks is that they are deterministic. In other words, it is easy to calculate 
the maximum time that will pass before a device has the opportunity to send 
data. This explains the popularity of token-passing networks in some real-time 
environments such as factories, where machinery must be capable of communicating 
at a determinable interval. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">For CSMA/CD networks, switches segment 
the network into multiple collision domains. This reduces the number of devices 
per network segment that must contend for the media. By creating smaller 
collision domains, the performance of a network can be increased significantly 
without requiring addressing changes. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Normally CSMA/CD networks are 
half-duplex, meaning that while a device sends information, it cannot receive at 
the time. While that device is talking, it is incapable of also listening for 
other traffic. This is much like a walkie-talkie. When one person wants to talk, 
he presses the transmit button and begins speaking. While he is talking, no one 
else on the same frequency can talk. When the sending person is finished, he 
releases the transmit button and the frequency is available to others. </font>
</p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">When switches are introduced, 
full-duplex operation is possible. Full-duplex works much like a telephone—you 
can listen as well as talk at the same time. When a network device is attached 
directly to the port of a network switch, the two devices may be capable of 
operating in full-duplex mode. In full-duplex mode, performance can be 
increased, but <br>
not quite as much as some like to claim. A 100-Mbps Ethernet segment is capable 
of transmitting 200 Mbps of data, but only 100 Mbps can travel in one direction 
at a time. Because most data connections are asymmetric (with more data 
traveling in one direction than the other), the gain is not as great as many 
claim. However, full-duplex operation does increase the throughput of most 
applications because the network media is no longer shared. Two devices on a 
full-duplex connection can send data as soon as it is ready. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Token-passing networks such as Token 
Ring can also benefit from network switches. In large networks, the delay 
between turns to transmit may be significant because the token is passed around 
the network. </font></p>
<h2 class="p_H_Head1"><font face="Arial" size="3">LAN Transmission Methods </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">LAN data transmissions fall into three 
classifications: unicast, multicast, and broadcast. <br>
In each type of transmission, a single packet is sent to one or more nodes.
</font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">In a
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">unicast transmission</span>, 
a single packet is sent from the source to a destination on a network. First, 
the source node addresses the packet by using the address of the destination 
node. The package is then sent onto the network, and finally, the network passes 
the packet to its destination. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">A
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">multicast transmission</span> 
consists of a single data packet that is copied and sent to a specific subset of 
nodes on the network. First, the source node addresses the packet by using a 
multicast address. The packet is then sent into the network, which makes copies 
of the packet and sends a copy to each node that is part of the multicast 
address. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">A
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">broadcast transmission</span> 
consists of a single data packet that is copied and sent to all nodes on the 
network. In these types of transmissions, the source node addresses the packet 
by using the broadcast address. The packet is then sent on to the network, which 
makes copies of the packet and sends a copy to every node on the network. </font>
</p>
<h2 class="p_H_Head1"><font face="Arial" size="3">LAN Topologies </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">LAN topologies define the manner in 
which network devices are organized. Four common LAN topologies exist: bus, 
ring, star, and tree. These topologies are logical architectures, but the actual 
devices need not be physically organized in these configurations. Logical bus 
and ring topologies, for example, are commonly organized physically as a star. A
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">bus topology</span> is a 
linear LAN architecture in which transmissions from network stations propagate 
the length of the medium and are received by all other stations. Of the three
<br>
most widely used LAN implementations, Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 networks—including 
100BaseT—implement a bus topology, which is illustrated in Figure 2-3. </font>

<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">ring topology</span> is a 
LAN architecture that consists of a series of devices connected to one another

Ring/IEEE 802.5 and FDDI networks implement a ring topology. Figure 2-4 depicts 
a logical ring topology. </font></p>

<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">star topology</span> is a 
LAN architecture in which the endpoints on a network are connected to a common

often implemented physically in a star topology, which is illustrated in Figure 
2-5. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">A
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">tree topology</span> is a

<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">repeater</span> is a 
physical layer device used to interconnect the media segments of an extended 
network. A repeater essentially enables a series of cable segments to be treated 
as a single cable. Repeaters receive signals from one network segment and 
amplify, retime, and retransmit those signals to another network segment. These 
actions prevent signal deterioration caused by long cable lengths and large 
numbers of connected devices. Repeaters are incapable of performing complex 
filtering and other traffic processing. In addition, all electrical signals, 
including electrical disturbances and other errors, are repeated and amplified. 
The total number of repeaters and network segments that can be connected is 
limited due to timing and other issues. Figure 2-6 illustrates a repeater 
connecting two network segments. </font></p>

<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">hub</span> is a physical

protocol type. LAN extenders scale well because the host router filters out 
unwanted broadcasts and multicasts. However, LAN extenders are not capable of 
segmenting traffic or creating security firewalls. Figure 2-7 illustrates 
multiple LAN extenders connected to the host router through a WAN. </font></p>

<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal">Q—</span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Describe 
unicast, multicast, and broadcast transmissions.</span> </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal">A—</span>A unicast is a 
transmission from one source to one destination. A multicast is a transmission 
from one source to many stations that register to receive the traffic. A 
broadcast is a transmission from one source to every station on the local 
network segment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The components in a Local Area Network can be connected in a few ways, which 
is call LAN topologies. There exit 4 basic LAN topologies:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Star: All stations are connected by cable (or wireless) to a central point, 
such as hub or a switch. If the central node is operating in a broadcast fashion 
such as a Hub, transmission of a frame from one station to the node is 
retransmitted on all of the outgoing links. In this case, although the 
arrangement is physically a star, it is logically a bus. In the case of the 
central node acting as switch, an incoming frame is processed in the node and 
then retransmitted on an outgoing link to the destination station. Ethernet 
protocols (IEEE 802.3) are often used in the Star topology LAN.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Ring: All nodes on the LAN are connected in a loop and their Network 
Interface Cards (NIC) are working as repeaters. There is no starting or ending 
point. Each node will repeat any signal that is on the network regardless its 
destination. The destination station recognizes its address and copies the frame 
into a local buffer as it goes by. The frame continues to circulate until it 
returns to the source station, where it is removed. Token Ring (IEEE 802.5) is 
the most popular Ring topology protocol. FDDI (IEEE 802.6) is another protocol 
used in the Ring topology, which is based on the Token Ring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Bus: All nodes on the LAN are connected by one linear cable, which is called 
the shared medium. Every node on this cable segment sees transmissions from 
every other station on the same segment. At each end of the bus is a terminator, 
which absorbs any signal, removing it from the bus. This medium cable apparently 
is the single point of failure. Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is the protocols used for 
this type of LAN.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Tree: The tree topology is a logical extension of the bus topology. The 
transmission medium is a branching cable with no closed loops. The tree layout 
begins at a point called the head-end, where one or more cables start, and each 
of these may have branches. The branches in turn may have additional branches to 
allow quite complex layouts. </font> </p>

<h2><font size="3" face="Arial">Foreword</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">I will use a few terms in this tutorial that need explanation before we get 
started.</font></p>
<dl>
  <dt><font face="Arial">Station </font> </dt>
  <dd><font face="Arial">A <em>station</em> is a computer 
  workstation or computing device attached to a network. </font> </dd>
  <dt><font face="Arial">Segment </font> </dt>
  <dd><font face="Arial">A <em>segment</em> is a cable between any two stations or network devices, 
  or between any station and network device. </font> </dd>
  <dt><font face="Arial">Network Device </font> </dt>
  <dd><font face="Arial">A <em>network device</em> is any device used to interconnect segments of 
  the network. </font> </dd>
</dl>
<p><font face="Arial">Why do I use these terms? Because the standards documentation uses them and I 
really should be consistent because the Cisco and Network+ tests use these same 
terms as the documented standards for most protocols. If you ever suffer from 
insomnia and need to read the documented standards (which WILL put you to 
sleep), I don't want you getting confused--that would muddle your dreams and we 
wouldn't want <em>that</em>, would we?</font></p>
<h2><b><font size="3" face="Arial">BUS TOPOLOGY</font></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Networks employing a bus topology use a 
common physical connection for communication. That means the physical media is 
shared between stations. When one station transmits on the bus, all devices hear 
the transmission. If more than one device transmits at the same time, the two 
transmissions will collide with each other and both transmissions will destroy 
each other.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">When two or more of these 
devices attempts to access the network bus at the same time, some method must be 
used to prevent a collision (CSMA/CD). Historically, bus networks used coaxial 
cable as their medium of transmission. Token Bus, Ethernet (Thinnet and Thicknet) 
are common examples of bus topologies. Although some installations of Ethernet 
using coaxial cable still exist, all modern installations now use a hub and 
spoke or star topology.</span></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
    <img src="topology_bus.png" width="260" height="235"></font></p>
<h2><b><font size="3" face="Arial">HUB AND SPOKE (STAR)</font></b></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">Please note that this is not called a <em>hub and spoke</em> 
    design because there is a network hub in the drawing. This drawing is to 
    show how a <em>star</em> or <em>hub and spoke</em> network resembles the hub 
    and spokes of a wheel. The Hub and Spoke topology refers to a network 
    topology where there is a central connection point to which multiple devices 
    are connected. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">A network hub device is not the only device usable in this configuration. 
    A switch may also be used and in some cases, a router. Ethernet utilizing 
    twisted pair still considered a bus architecture from a logical standpoint; 
    however, physically, an
    Ethernet network can be <em>physically</em> wired as a hub and spoke 
    model.</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
    <img src="topology_star.gif" border="0" width="247" height="196"></font></p>
<h2><b><font size="3" face="Arial">RING</font></b></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">Ring topologies are similar to bus 
    topologies, except they transmit in one direction only from station to 
    station. Typically, a ring architecture will use separate physical ports and 
    wires for transmit and receive. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Token Ring is one example of a network technology that uses a ring 
    topology. </font>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
    <img src="topology_ring.gif" width="240" height="186"></font></p>
<h2><b><font size="3" face="Arial">POINT TO POINT (Daisy Chaining)</font></b></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">Point to Point topologies are simplest and most 
    straightforward. You must picture them as a chain of devices and another 
    name for this type of connectivity is called <em>daisy chaining</em>. Most 
    computers can 'daisy chain' a series of serial devices from one of its 
    serial ports. Networks of routers are often configured as point-to-point 
    topologies.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
    <img src="topology_pt2pt.gif" width="251" height="77"></font></p>
<h2><b><font size="3" face="Arial">POINT TO MULTIPOINT</font></b></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">This is not quite the same as a hub and 
    spoke configuration. In a hub and 
    spoke topology, all transmissions from all devices pass through the 
    hub--the hub broadcasts all communication from any single device to all 
    other devices connected to it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">In a multipoint topology the hub can send to one or more systems based on 
    an address.
    Frame Relay is the most common technology to implement this scheme, and 
    it is typically used as a WAN 
    technology. All the remote connection points are connected to a single
    Frame Relay switch or router port, and communication between sites is 
    managed by that central point. In hub and spoke, all spokes or only one 
    spoke hears a given transmission. In point to multipoint, any number of 
    remote stations can be accessed.</font></p>
