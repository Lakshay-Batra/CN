TRANSMISSION</b></font></u></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data transmission means sending a stream of bits or bytes 
from one location to another using any number of technologies, such as copper 
wire, optical fiber, laser, radio, or infra-red light. Practical examples 
include moving data from one data storage device to another such as accessing a 
website, which involves data transfer from web servers to a user's browser.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Serial transmission</b> bits are sent over a single 
wire individually. Whilst only one bit is sent at a time, high transfer rates 
are possible. This can be used over longer distances as a check digit or Parity 
bit can be sent along it easily.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Parallel transmission</b> Multiple wires are used and 
transmit multiple bits simultaneously and is much faster than Serial 
transmission as one byte can be sent rather than one bit. This method is used 
internally within the computer, for example the internal buses, and sometimes 
externally for such things as printers, how ever the major issue with this is 
&quot;skewing&quot; because the wires in parallel data transmission have slightly 
different properties (not intentionally) so some bits may arrive before others, 
which means that the original &quot;meaning&quot; of the message is lost and thus leads to 
corruption a parity bit can help to reduce this. how ever parallel data 
transmission is therefore unsuitable for long distances (as already mentioned) 
because skewing is far more likely.<br>
<br>
<b>Asynchronous transmission</b> uses start and stop bits to signify the 
beginning bit ASCII character would actually be transmitted using 10 bits e.g.: 
A &quot;0100 0001&quot; would become &quot;1 0100 0001 0&quot;. The extra one (or zero depending on 
parity bit) at the start and end of the transmission tells the receiver first 
that a character is coming and secondly that the character has ended. This 
method of transmission is used when data is sent intermittently as opposed to in 
a solid stream. In the previous example the start and stop bits are in bold. The 
start and stop bits must be of opposite polarity. This allows the receiver to 
recognize when the second packet of information is being sent.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Synchronous transmission</b> uses no start and stop 
bits but instead synchronizes transmission speeds at both the receiving and 
sending end of the transmission using clock signals built into each component. A 
continual stream of data is then sent between the two nodes. Due to there being 
no start and stop bits the data transfer rate is quicker although more errors 
will occur, as the clocks will eventually get out of sync, and the receiving 
device would have the wrong time that had been agreed in protocol (computing) 
for sending/receiving data, so some bytes could become corrupted (by losing 
bits). Ways to get around this problem include re-synchronization of the clocks 
and use of check digits to ensure the byte is correctly interpreted and 
received.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Asynchronous data transmission</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">An asynchronous data transmission involves a mechanism 
called a queue. In general, a queue is a service which temporarily holds 
messages destined for a receiving task until that task is ready to process them. 
The sending task passes messages off to the queue and does not wait for a 
response from the receiver. The queue guarantees that if it accepts a message 
then that message will be delivered. Cogent's asynchronous messaging is 
implemented through a queue administrator, called Cascade QueueServer, or </font>
<b class="command"><tt><font face="Arial">qserve</font></tt></b><font face="Arial">.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
<img alt="Asynchronous data transmission" src="dh-queue.gif" align="middle" width="393" height="64"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>&nbsp;Asynchronous data transmission</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the example above, when task 1 sends a message to task 
2 it does so through the queue administrator. Task 1 transmits the message to 
the queue administrator, which replies immediately with an acknowledgment that 
it has held the message for delivery pending a request from task 2. Task 1 can 
now continue with its other duties without having to wait for task 2 to process 
the message.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The queue administrator then sends a <i class="firstterm">
signal</i> to task 2 telling it that there is a message waiting for it in the 
queue. A signal is a special operating system mechanism that cannot block on 
another task and in this case acts like a flag to indicate to task 2 that there 
is a message waiting. This means that the queue program is never blocked waiting 
for a reply from a task that it has informed about a message waiting.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Task 2 sends a request for the waiting message and 
receives the data in a reply from the queue administrator. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It should be noted that the queue administrator never 
initiates a message transaction, and due to the nature of the send/receive/reply 
mechanism it will never block while transmitting a reply. Thus a queue 
administrator in this scenario will always be available to receive messages and 
the originator of an asynchronous message will never block.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There are a number of disadvantages to using asynchronous 
message passing. The sender and receiver in an asynchronous transaction must 
agree upon a queue name in order for the queue administrator to correctly route 
a message. This requires either hard-coded queue names, command-line arguments, 
or a queue-aware name server so tasks can discover the destination queue names. 
The Cascade DataHub uses a queue-aware name server called </font>
<b class="command"><tt><font face="Arial">nserve</font></tt></b><font face="Arial"> 
to provide maximum flexibility in asynchronous connections.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A second concern is that because asynchronous transmission 
introduces additional message passing overhead into the transmission mechanism, 
the speed of asynchronous transmission will tend to be slower than that of 
synchronous data transfer. Perhaps the biggest drawback of the asynchronous 
transmission method is that there must be a method of dealing with overflows in 
the queue. If the receiving task fails to collect its messages from the queue 
administrator, or if it cannot keep up with the rate at which messages are being 
sent to the queue administrator, then eventually messages will build up and the 
queue administrator will run out of buffer space. At this point, the queue 
administrator must refuse further incoming messages until the receiver has 
cleared some of its pending messages. The sending task must include a 
contingency plan for undeliverable messages.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A sending task may react in several ways to a full queue 
situation: </font></p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Throw away data that cannot be put on the queue.&nbsp;</b> 
  This is both the most common and least acceptable response to a full queue. 
  The most recent data will be lost, and old data currently on the queue will be 
  retained. Once the condition causing the full queue has been cleared, the most 
  recent data will be unavailable. In the case of process control systems, this 
  scenario will fail to transmit the most recent process changes. Obviously, 
  this method is not attractive when you consider the potential loss of state 
  change information and critical alarm data. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Throw away the oldest data on the queue.&nbsp;</b> This 
  method is only viable if the queue is held internally to the sending task. In 
  most cases, a task cannot walk the queue as it is provided by an external 
  program or operating system facility. Even if the queue is available to the 
  sender, there is no guarantee that the oldest data is the least important. In 
  general, eliminating data solely on the basis of age is unacceptable. (In the 
  case of the QNX queue administrator, </font><b class="command"><tt>
  <font face="Arial">Mqueue</font></tt></b><font face="Arial">, this method of 
  dealing with a full queue is not an option, as the queue is held externally to 
  the sender.) </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Throw away the oldest duplicate data on the queue.&nbsp;</b> 
  As above, this option is only available if the queue is internal to the 
  sender. In addition, it implies that the data in the queue is of a known type 
  and format, and can be examined for its similarity to new data. In the case of 
  process control points, this is generally true, though it means that every 
  point being transmitted must be compared to every queued message to determine 
  whether it should replace a current message or go to the end of the queue. 
  Depending on the implementation, this mechanism may not preserve time ordering 
  in the queued data. The Cascade DataHub uses a generalized external queue 
  mechanism, and so does not provide this type of data reduction. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Try to send the data again later.&nbsp;</b> If a task 
  cannot deliver a message to the queue immediately, then it has the option of 
  holding the message for later transmission. Once space is available in the 
  queue, the message can be re-transmitted. This method actually means that the 
  sender is implementing its own internal queue, duplicating the work of the 
  queue facility, and so is subject to all of the same concerns regarding full 
  buffers and data reduction. In general, this approach by itself is entirely 
  useless, and is exactly equivalent to enlarging the size of the queue 
  administrator's buffers. When used in combination with one of the other 
  methods mentioned here, this approach could be very effective. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Try to send the data again later, throwing away old 
  duplicate data from the retry queue only.&nbsp;</b> This is the method used by the 
  Cascade DataHub to deal with undeliverable data. So long as the receiver is 
  capable of keeping up with the data transmission rate, all point changes are 
  deliverable. If the receiver allows its queue to fill, then the Cascade 
  DataHub will flag the point as pending delivery to the recipient and will 
  attempt to deliver the most recent value for that point as soon as there is 
  room in the queue. If another change to a pending point is received by the 
  DataHub, then the previous value is overwritten, so that when room in the 
  queue becomes available, the new value is transmitted. In addition, the 
  Cascade DataHub packages many point changes into a single message whenever 
  there are several pending points to a task, thereby increasing the bandwidth 
  of the queue administrator during periods of high load. In this way, the 
  Cascade DataHub will transmit all point changes to any receiver that can 
  handle the data rate, and guarantees that even slow receivers (such as GUI 
  applications and applications on dial-up lines) will always receive the most 
  recent point values even if they miss some intermediate values.</font></li>
</ol>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Synchronous data transmission</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Consider the following diagram that represents two 
programs (or tasks) communicating with each other using send/receive/reply 
message protocol.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
<img alt="Synchronous data transmission" src="dh-sendreply.gif" align="middle" width="248" height="56"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>&nbsp;Synchronous data transmission</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Task 1 sends a message to task 2. Using synchronous 
transmission, task 1 will not be able to continue processing until it has either 
received a reply from task 2 or the message transmission has failed. The message 
may fail to send due to a couple of reasons. The recipient task may die which 
means the message will fail to be sent, or the attempt to send the message may 
time-out waiting for a reply.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There may be a substantial time delay associated with task 
2 processing the message and then sending back the reply to task 1. In the 
example above, task 1 is said to be 'blocked' on task 2 until it receives the 
reply to its original message.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In many mission critical applications, having one task 
blocked on another task is unacceptable because the blocked tasks are unable to 
perform other duties for the duration of the message transaction.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Synchronous transmission is, however, a fast and reliable 
method of data transfer when you absolutely need to know that a message was 
received by the recipient, or when the sending task must have a response before 
it can continue processing.</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">Synchronous Transmission</font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The principle difference between the 
synchronous and asynchronous modes of transmission is that in the synchronous 
case, the receiver uses a clock which is synchronised to the transmitter clock. 
The clock may be transferred by:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A separate interface circuit (as in X.21 
  or RS-449) or </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial">Encoded in the data (e.g. Manchester 
  Encoding, AMI encoding, HDB3 encoding) <br clear="all">
  <br clear="all">

  <li>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><i>Communication 
  by encoding the clock signal along with data.<br clear="all">
&nbsp;</i></font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">An encoded clock is used in systems such 
as G.703, and Ethernet. In an encoded system, the receiver can regenerate a copy 
of the transmitter clock at the receiver using a digital phase locked loop 
(dpll).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Synchronous transmission has the advantage 
that the timing information is accurately aligned to the received data, allowing 
operation at much higher data rates. It also has the advantage that the receiver 
tracks any clock drift which may arise (for instance due to temperature 
variation). The penalty is however a more complex interface design, and 
potentially a more difficult interface to configure (since there are many more 
interface options). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Analog vs. Digital Transmission</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>T</b>here are three predominant methods of encoding a 
transmission signal. Amplitude modulation (AM), and frequency modulation (FM) 
are both analog modulation schemes. The third method is digital modulation.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>A</b>M, FM, and digital modulation are described in 
detail in other sections of this web site. One key difference between analog and 
digital transmission involves the bandwidth, or transmission capacity required 
for both schemes. Analog signals require much less bandwidth, only about 4.5 MHz 
with a 143.2 Mb/s data rate. for the average NTSC video signal. By comparison, 
some digital video transmission standards require as much as 74.25 MHz with a 
data rate of 1485 Mb/s. Advances in single-mode optical fiber make these higher 
rates more accessible for longer distances. Copper coax fails to perform at 
these data rates. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>A</b>nother difference between analog and digital 
transmission deals with the hardware’s ability to recover the transmitted 
signal. Analog modulation, which is continuously variable by nature, can often 
require adjustment at the receiver end in order to reconstruct the transmitted 
signal. Digital transmission, however, because it uses only 1’s and 0’s to 
encode the signal, offers a simpler means of reconstructing the signal. Both 
types of modulation can incorporate error detecting and error correcting 
information to the transmitted signal. However, the latest trend in signal 
transmission is forward error correcting (FEC). This scheme, which uses binary 
numbers, is suited to digital transmission. Extra bits of information are 
incorporated into the digital signal, allowing any transmission errors to be 
corrected at the receive end.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>A</b> third important difference relates to the cost of 
analog transmission links compared to digital transmission links. Because the 
circuitry required for digital transmission is more complex, the cost is often 
much higher. In short distance applications, analog modulation will almost 
always be the most cost-effective system to specify. However, today’s demand for 
high speed Internet, video-on-demand, videoconferencing, and &quot;pushed&quot; data 
directly to our home computers requires moderate to long-distance transmission 
systems to specify digital equipment. And as is the case with any form of 
technology, greater demand will lead to mass production, inevitably driving the 
cost of digital systems down. However, it will always be true that the decision 
to specify one type of modulation over the other involves the same system design 
considerations.</font></p>
