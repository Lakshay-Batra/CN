<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><i>1)</i></b> Short 
for <b><i>P</i></b><i>ost <b>O</b>ffice <b>P</b>rotocol,</i> a protocol used to 
retrieve e-mail from a mail server. Most e-mail applications (sometimes called 
an <i>e-mail client</i>) use the POP protocol, although some can use the newer 
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There are two versions of POP. The first, 
called <i>POP2,</i> became a standard in the mid-80's and requires SMTP to send 
messages. The newer version, POP3, can be used with or without SMTP. </font></p>
<p nd="3" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><i>(2)</i></b> Short for <b><i>p</i></b><i>oint
<b>o</b>f <b>p</b>resence,</i> an access point to the Internet. ISPs have 
typically multiple POPs. A point of presence is a physical location, either part 
of the facilities of a telecommunications provider that the ISP rents or a 
separate location from the telecommunications provider that houses servers, 
routers, ATM switches and digital/analog call aggregators. </font></p>
<p nd="4" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><i>(3)</i></b> Short for <b><i>P</i></b><i>rogrammed
<b>Op</b>erator </i>(POP), a pseudo-opcode in a virtual machine language 
executed by an interpretive program. The Programmed Operator instructions 
provide the ability to define an instruction set for efficient encoding by 
calling subprograms into primary memory. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In computing, local e-mail clients use the
<b>Post Office Protocol version 3</b> (<b>POP3</b>), an application-layer 
Internet standard protocol, to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a 
TCP/IP connection. Nearly all subscribers to individual Internet service 
provider e-mail accounts access their e-mail with client software that uses 
POP3.</font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">POP3 has made earlier versions of the protocol obsolete, POP 
(informally called POP1) and POP2. In contemporary usage, the less precise term
<i>POP</i> almost always means <i>POP3</i> in the context of e-mail protocols.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">The design of POP3 and its predecessors supports end users with 
intermittent connections (such as dial-up connections), allowing these users to 
retrieve e-mail when connected and then to view and manipulate the retrieved 
messages without needing to stay connected. Although most clients have an option 
to <i>leave mail on server</i>, e-mail clients using POP3 generally connect, 
retrieve all messages, store them on the user's PC as new messages, delete them 
from the server, and then disconnect. In contrast, the newer, more capable 
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) supports both <i>connected</i> and <i>
disconnected</i> modes of operation. E-mail clients using IMAP generally leave 
messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. This and other 
facets of IMAP operation allow multiple clients to access the same mailbox. Most 
e-mail clients support either POP3 or IMAP to retrieve messages; however, fewer 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) support IMAP. The fundamental difference 
between POP3 and IMAP4 is that POP3 offers access to a mail drop; the mail 
exists on the server until it is collected by the client. Even if the client 
leaves some or all messages on the server, the client's message store is 
considered authoritative. In contrast, IMAP4 offers access to the mail store; 
the client may store local copies of the messages, but these are considered to 
be a temporary cache; the server's store is authoritative.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Clients with a <i>leave mail on server</i> option generally use 
the POP3 UIDL (<b>U</b>nique <b>ID</b>entification <b>L</b>isting) command. Most 
POP3 commands identify specific messages by their ordinal number on the mail 
server. This creates a problem for a client intending to leave messages on the 
server, since these message numbers may change from one connection to the server 
to another. For example if a mailbox contains five messages at last connect, and 
a different client then deletes message #3, the next connecting user will find 
the last two messages' numbers decremented by one. UIDL provides a mechanism to 
avoid these numbering issues. The server assigns a string of characters as a 
permanent and unique ID for the message. When a POP3-compatible e-mail client 
connects to the server, it can use the UIDL command to get the current mapping 
from these message IDs to the ordinal message numbers. The client can then use 
this mapping to determine which messages it has yet to download, which saves 
time when downloading. IMAP has a similar mechanism, using a 32-bit UID (<b>U</b>nique
<b>ID</b>entifier) that is required to be strictly ascending. The advantage of 
the numeric UID is with large mailboxes; a client can request just the UIDs 
greater than its previously stored &quot;highest UID&quot;. In POP, the client must fetch 
the entire UIDL map.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Whether using POP3 or IMAP to retrieve messages, e-mail clients 
typically use the SMTP_Submit profile of the SMTP protocol to send messages. 
E-mail clients are commonly categorized as either <i>POP</i> or <i>IMAP</i> 
clients, but in both cases the clients also use SMTP. There are extensions to 
POP3 that allow some clients to transmit outbound mail via POP3 - these are 
known as &quot;XTND XMIT&quot; extensions. The Qualcomm qpopper and CommuniGate Pro 
servers and Eudora clients are examples of systems that optionally utilize the 
XTND XMIT methods of authenticated client-to-server e-mail transmission.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">MIME serves as the standard for attachments and non-ASCII text 
in e-mail. Although neither POP3 nor SMTP require MIME-formatted e-mail, 
essentially all Internet e-mail comes MIME-formatted, so POP clients must also 
understand and use MIME. IMAP, by design, assumes MIME-formatted e-mail.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Like many other older Internet protocols, POP3 originally 
supported only an unencrypted login mechanism. Although plain text transmission 
of passwords in POP3 still commonly occurs, POP3 currently supports several 
authentication methods to provide varying levels of protection against 
illegitimate access to a user's e-mail. One such method, <b>APOP</b>, uses the 
MD5 hash function in an attempt to avoid replay attacks and disclosure of a 
shared secret. Clients implementing APOP include Mozilla, Thunderbird, Opera, 
Eudora, KMail and Novell Evolution. POP3 clients can also support SASL 
authentication methods via the AUTH extension.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">POP3 works over a TCP/IP connection using TCP on network port 
110. E-mail clients can encrypt POP3 traffic using TLS or SSL. A TLS or SSL 
connection is negotiated using the <b>STLS</b> command. Some clients and 
servers, like Google Gmail, instead use the deprecated alternate-port method, 
which uses TCP port 995.</span></font></p>
<h2 style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">
<span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN">POP4</span></span></font></h2>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">While not yet an official standardized mail protocol, a proposal 
has been outlined for a POP4 specification, complete with a working server 
implementation.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">The proposed POP4 extension adds basic folder management, 
multipart message support, as well as message flag management, allowing for a 
light protocol which supports some popular IMAP features which POP3 currently 
lacks.</span></font></p>
<h2 style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">
<span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN">SDPS</span></span></font></h2>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Demon Internet introduced extensions to POP3 that allow multiple 
accounts per domain, and has become known as <i>Standard Dial-up POP3 Service</i> 
(SDPS). </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The POP3 protocol is the third version of 
POP (Post Office Protocol), a protocol that is used to transfer mail saved for a 
user to the user's computer. POP3 has an assigned port of 110. In order to 
manipulate mail on a POP server, we will need to authenticate first. We can do 
this using the USER and PASS commands together. Following is part of a complete 
session, in which we just authenticate. It is edited slightly to remove my 
username and password on the remote system. User Input is Italicized.<br>

This example will not exactly match that on your server, but it will be fairly 
similar. Now that we have authenticated on the server, we have access to a wide 
range of POP3 commands:<br>

</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Note that the TOP command is not required 
to be implemented by all POP3 servers. However, it is implemented by most POP 
servers, so we will assume it to be available. Following is an example session 
that utilizes all of the above POP commands.<br>
