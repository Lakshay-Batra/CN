Video conferencing </span></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Video 
conferencing is a medium where individuals or groups can meet face-to-face in 
real time to interact. It requires a computer (Mac or PC) with

<b>Connectix Quickcam</b></a>) and an Internet connection, preferably ISDN or 
better. Bringing the world into the classroom through the use of this technology 
is becoming increasingly more popular.</span></p>

Video Conferencing </span></font></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Better Planning: 
Planning ahead is an essential part of the video conference. The preparation 
time yields big returns when students and teachers are well prepared for the 
exchange of information. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Interaction with 
Experts: Students are able to get answers to questions from experts who, because 
of time and distance, would otherwise be inaccessible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Learn about 
cultural differences: Students are able to interact with other students and 
adults who may be very different from themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Addresses 
different Learning Styles: It can include media such as video clips, animations, 
audio and graphics. This first hand learning is especially good for visual 
learners. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Increases 
Motivation: You will find that students are much more willing to do the research 
when they know that they will be presenting it to other classes. Most students 
enjoy using the new technology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Better 
Retention: Students are learning from a primary source rather than a textbook.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Improve Skills:</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Types of Conferences</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Person to Person 
(or Class to Class) This is the simplest form of conference where two computers 
connect directly with each other using CU-SeeMe software or some other 
conferencing software. All you have to do is type in the IP address of the 
person or class you would like to connect with for a conference. Much the same 
way you would dial up a friend on the phone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Group 
Conference: This is where many people can participate and collaborate. To do 
this, each person or class has to connect to a site that is running Reflector 
software. The connection is made by typing in the IP address of the Reflector. 
The Reflector receives everything that is transmitted by the group and then 
transmits it to the others in the group.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Broadcast: This 
is one way conferencing much like television. One computer running Reflector 
software transmits audio and video to all those who are connected. NASA TV is a 
good example. You can tune to NASA TV by connecting via CU-SeeMe to IP 
Address:139.88.27.43 or IP 129.186.112.242 .</span></p>
