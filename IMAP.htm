<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>IMAP</b> stands for Internet Message 
Access Protocol. It is a method of accessing electronic mail or bulletin board 
messages that are kept on a (possibly shared) mail server. In other words, it 
permits a &quot;client&quot; email program to access remote message stores as if they were 
local. For example, email stored on an IMAP server can be manipulated from a 
desktop computer at home, a workstation at the office, and a notebook computer 
while traveling, without the need to transfer messages or files back and forth 
between these computers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">IMAP's ability to access messages (both 
new and saved) from more than one computer has become extremely important as 
reliance on electronic messaging and use of multiple computers increase, but 
this functionality cannot be taken for granted: the widely used Post Office 
Protocol (POP) works best when one has only a single computer, since it was 
designed to support &quot;offline&quot; message access, wherein messages are downloaded 
and then deleted from the mail server. This mode of access is not compatible 
with access from multiple computers since it tends to sprinkle messages across 
all of the computers used for mail access. Thus, unless all of those machines 
share a common file system, the offline mode of access that POP was designed to 
support effectively ties the user to one computer for message storage and 
manipulation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Key goals for IMAP include:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Be fully compatible with Internet 
  messaging standards, e.g. MIME. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Allow message access and management from 
  more than one computer. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Allow access without reliance on less 
  efficient file access protocols. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Provide support for &quot;online&quot;, &quot;offline&quot;, 
  and &quot;disconnected&quot; access modes </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Support for concurrent access to shared 
  mailboxes </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Client software needs no knowledge about 
  the server's file store format. </font></li>
</ol>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The protocol includes operations for 
creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes; checking for new messages; 
permanently removing messages; setting and clearing flags; server-based RFC-822 
and MIME parsing (so clients don't need to), and searching; and selective 
fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof for efficiency.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">IMAP was originally developed in 1986 at 
Stanford University. However, it did not command the attention of mainstream 
email vendors until a decade later, and it is still not as well-known as earlier 
and less-capable alternatives such as POP, though that is rapidly changing. With 
webmail products becoming increasingly popular, the use of the IMAP protocol is 
increasing quite rapidly.</font></p>

retrieving e-mail messages. The latest version, <i>IMAP4,</i> is similar to <i>
POP3</i> but supports some additional features. For example, with IMAP4, you can 
search through your e-mail messages for keywords while the messages are still on 
mail server. You can then choose which messages to download to your machine.

<span lang="EN">E-mail messages are generally sent to an e-mail server that 
stores received messages in the recipient's e-mail mailbox. The user later 
retrieves these messages with either a web browser or an e-mail client that uses 
one of a number of e-mail retrieval protocols. While some clients and servers 
preferentially use vendor specific, typically proprietary protocols, most 
support the Internet standard protocols SMTP for sending e-mail and POP3 and 
IMAP4 for retrieving e-mail, allowing interoperability with other servers and 
clients. For example, Microsoft's Outlook client typically uses a proprietary 
protocol to communicate with an Exchange server as does IBM's Notes client when 
communicating with a Domino server, but all of these products also support SMTP, 
POP3, and IMAP4. Support for the Internet standard protocols allows many other 
e-mail clients such as Qualcomm's Eudora or Mozilla Thunderbird to access these 
servers and similarly allows the clients to be used with other servers.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">E-mail clients can generally be configured to use either POP3 or 
IMAP4 to retrieve e-mail and in both cases use SMTP for sending. Most e-mail 
programs can also use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for directory 
services.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Nearly all subscribers to individual Internet service provider 
e-mail accounts access their e-mail with client software that uses POP3.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">IMAP is often used in large networks; for example, a college 
campus mail system. IMAP allows users to access new messages instantly on their 
computers, since the mail is stored on the network. With POP3, users either <b>
download</b> the e-mail to their computer or access it via the web. Both methods 
take longer than IMAP, and the user must either download any new mail or &quot;<i>refresh</i>&quot; 
the page to see the new messages.</span></font></p>

protocol, in contrast to the widely used POP, a protocol for retrieving the 
contents of a Mailbox.</span></font></p>

<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">The original <i>Interim Mail Access Protocol</i> was implemented 
as a Xerox Lisp Machine client and a TOPS-20 server.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">No copies of the original interim protocol or its software 
exist; all known installations of the original protocol were updated to IMAP2. 
Although some of its commands and responses were similar to IMAP2, the interim 
protocol lacked command/response tagging and thus its syntax was incompatible 
with all other versions of IMAP.</span></font></p>

Mail Access Protocol</i> (IMAP2) introduced command/response tagging and was the 
first publicly distributed version.</span></font></p>

<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">With the advent of MIME, IMAP2 was extended to support MIME body 
structures and add mailbox management functionality (create, delete, rename, 
message upload) that was absent in IMAP2. This experimental revision was called 
IMAP2bis; its specification was never published in non-draft form. Early 
versions of Pine were widely distributed with IMAP2bis support (Pine 4.00 and 
later supports IMAP4rev1).</span></font></p>
<h3 style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><span class="mw-headline">
<span lang="EN"><font size="3">IMAP4</font></span></span></h3>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">An IMAP Working Group formed in the IETF in the early 1990s and 
took over responsibility for the IMAP2bis design. The IMAP WG decided to rename 
IMAP2bis to IMAP4 to avoid confusion with a competing IMAP3 proposal from 
another group that never got off the ground. The expansion of the IMAP acronym 
also changed to the <i>Internet Message Access Protocol</i>.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Some design flaws in the original IMAP4 that came out in 
implementation experience lead to its revision and replacement by IMAP4rev1 two 
years later. There were very few IMAP4 client or server implementations due to 
its short lifetime.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN">IMAP4rev1 is upwards compatible with IMAP2 and IMAP2bis; and is 
largely upwards-compatible with IMAP4. However, the older versions are either 
extinct or nearly so.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Unlike many older Internet protocols, IMAP4 natively supports 
encrypted login mechanisms. Plain-text transmission of passwords in IMAP4 is 
also possible. Because the encryption mechanism to be used must be agreed 
between the server and client, plain-text passwords are used in some 
combinations of clients and servers (typically Microsoft Windows clients and 
non-Windows servers). It is also possible to encrypt IMAP4 traffic using SSL, 
either by tunneling IMAP4 communications over SSL on port 993, or by issuing 
STARTTLS within an established IMAP4 session.</span></font></p>

<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">When using POP3, clients typically connect to the e-mail server 
briefly, only as long as it takes to download new messages. When using IMAP4, 
clients often stay connected as long as the user interface is active and 
download message content on demand. For users with many or large messages, this 
IMAP4 usage pattern can result in much faster response times.</span></font></p>

<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">The POP3 protocol requires the currently connected client to be 
the only client connected to the mailbox. In contrast, the IMAP protocol 
specifically allows simultaneous access by multiple clients and provides 
mechanisms for clients to detect changes made to the mailbox by other, 
concurrently connected, clients.</span></font></p>

<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Nearly all internet e-mail is transmitted in MIME format, 
allowing messages to have a tree structure where the leaf nodes are any of a 
variety of <i>single part</i> content types and the non-leaf nodes are any of a 
variety of <i>multipart</i> types. The IMAP4 protocol allows clients to 
separately retrieve any of the individual MIME parts and also to retrieve 
portions of either individual parts or the entire message. These mechanisms 
allow clients to retrieve the text portion of a message without retrieving 
attached files or to stream content as it is being fetched.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN"><font size="3">Message state information</font></span></span></h3>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Through the use of <i>flags</i> defined in the IMAP4 protocol 
clients can keep track of message state, for example whether or not the message 
has been read, replied to, or deleted. These flags are stored on the server, so 
different clients accessing the same mailbox at different times can detect state 
changes made by other clients. POP3 provides no mechanism for clients to store 
such state information on the server so if a single user accesses a mailbox with 
two different POP3 clients state information, such as whether a message has been 
accessed, cannot be synchronized between the clients. The IMAP4 protocol 
supports both pre-defined system flags and client defined keywords, System flags 
indicate state information such as whether a message has been read. Keywords, 
which are not supported by all IMAP servers, allow messages to be given one or 
more

tags</a> whose meaning is up to the client. Adding user created tags to messages 
is an operation supported by some Webmail services, such as Gmail, although 
generally not using IMAP.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN">IMAP4 clients can create, rename, and/or delete mailboxes 
(usually presented to the user as folders) on the server, and move messages 
between mailboxes. Multiple mailbox support also allows servers to provide 
access to shared and public folders.</span></font></p>

these searches.</span></font></p>

<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Reflecting the experience of earlier Internet protocols, IMAP4 
defines an explicit mechanism by which it may be extended. Many extensions to 
the base protocol have been proposed and are in common use. IMAP2bis did not 
have an extension mechanism, and POP3 now has one.</span></font></p>

<span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN">Disadvantages of IMAP</span></span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Compared to POP3, IMAP4 is a very complicated protocol. 
Implementing IMAP is more difficult and error-prone than implementing POP3 for 
both client and server implementations at least in part because IMAP allows 
multiple clients to be connected to the same mailbox simultaneously. Despite 
this complexity, many modern email servers and clients use IMAP as their access 
default method.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Unless the mail store and searching algorithms on the server are 
carefully implemented, a client can potentially consume large amounts of server 
resources when searching massive mailboxes.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">IMAP4 clients need to explicitly request new email message 
content potentially causing additional delays on slow connections such as those 
commonly used by mobile devices. A private proposal, push IMAP, would extend 
IMAP to implement push e-mail by sending the entire message instead of just a 
notification. However, push IMAP has not been generally accepted and current 
IETF work has addressed the problem in other ways (see the Lemonade Profile for 
more information).</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Unlike some proprietary protocols which combine sending and 
retrieval operations, sending a message and saving a copy in a server-side 
folder with a base-level IMAP client requires transmitting the message content 
twice, once to SMTP for delivery and a second time to IMAP to store in a sent 
mail folder. This is remedied by a set of extensions defined by the IETF 
LEMONADE Working Group for mobile devices: URLAUTH and CATENATE in IMAP and BURL 
in SMTP-SUBMISSION. POP3 servers don't support server-side folders so clients 
have no choice but to store sent items on the client. IMAP clients can be 
configured to store sent mail in a client-side folder. In addition to the 
LEMONADE &quot;trio&quot;, Courier Mail Server offers a non-standard method of sending 
using IMAP by copying an outgoing message to a dedicated outbox folder.</span></font></p>
