<h1 class="articlePageTitle" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Storing 
Data on a DVD</font></h1>
<!-- dtl_id=6914 //-->
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">DVDs are of the same diameter and 
thickness as CDs, and they are made using some of the same materials and 
manufacturing methods. Like a CD, the data on a DVD is encoded in the form of 
small pits and bumps in the track of the disc. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A DVD is composed of several layers of 
plastic, totaling about 1.2 millimeters thick. Each layer is created by 
injection molding polycarbonate plastic. This process forms a disc that has 
microscopic bumps arranged as a single, continuous and extremely long spiral 
track of data. More on the bumps later. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Once the clear pieces of polycarbonate are 
formed, a thin reflective layer is sputtered onto the disc, covering the bumps. 
Aluminum is used behind the inner layers, but a semi-reflective gold layer is 
used for the outer layers, allowing the laser to focus through the outer and 
onto the inner layers. After all of the layers are made, each one is coated with 
lacquer, squeezed together and cured under infrared light. For single-sided 
discs, the label is silk-screened onto the nonreadable side. Double-sided discs 
are printed only on the nonreadable area near the hole in the middle. Cross 
sections of the various types of completed DVDs (not to scale) look like this:
</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="DVD1.gif" width="232" height="281"><br>
<b>DVD formats</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Each writable layer of a DVD has a spiral 
track of data. On single-layer DVDs, the track always circles from the inside of 
the disc to the outside. That the spiral track starts at the center means that a 
single-layer DVD can be smaller than 12 centimeters if desired. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">What the image to the right cannot impress 
upon you is how incredibly tiny the data track is -- just 740 nanometers 
separate one track from the next (a nanometer is a billionth of a meter). And 
the elongated bumps that make up the track are each 320 nanometers wide, a 
minimum of 400 nanometers long and 120 nanometers high. The following figure 
illustrates looking through the polycarbonate layer at the bumps. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">

<b>Data tracks on a DVD</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>DVD pit layout</b> </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">You will often read about &quot;pits&quot; on a DVD 
instead of bumps. They appear as pits on the aluminum side, but on the side that 
the laser reads from, they are bumps. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The microscopic dimensions of the bumps 
make the spiral track on a DVD extremely long. If you could lift the data track 
off a single layer of a DVD, and stretch it out into a straight line, it would 
be almost <b>7.5 miles</b> long! That means that a double-sided, double-layer 
DVD would have <b>30 miles</b> (48 km) of data! </font></p>
<h1 class="articlePageTitle" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Data 
Storage: DVD vs. CD</font></h1>
<!-- dtl_id=6916 //-->

</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000099">Higher Density Data

Single-sided, single-layer DVDs can store about seven times more data than CDs. 
A large part of this increase comes from the pits and tracks being smaller on 
DVDs. </font></p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Let's try to get an idea of how much more 
data can be stored due to the physically tighter spacing of pits on a DVD. The 
track pitch on a DVD is 2.16 times smaller, and the minimum pit length for a 
single-layer DVD is 2.08 times smaller than on a CD. By multiplying these two 
numbers, we find that there is room for about 4.5 times as many pits on a DVD. 
So where does the rest of the increase come from? </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000099">Less Overhead, More 
Area</font><br>
On a CD, there is a lot of extra information encoded on the disc to allow for 
error correction -- this information is really just a repetition of information 
that is already on the disc. The error correction scheme that a CD uses is quite 
old and inefficient compared to the method used on DVDs. The DVD format doesn't 
waste as much space on error correction, enabling it to store much more real 
information. Another way that DVDs achieve higher capacity is by encoding data 
onto a slightly larger area of the disc than is done on a CD. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000099">Multi-Layer Storage</font><br>
To increase the storage capacity even more, a DVD can have up to four layers, 
two on each side. The laser that reads the disc can actually focus on the second 
layer through the first layer. Here is a list of the capacities of different 
forms of DVDs: </font></p>

</table>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">You may be wondering why the capacity of a 
DVD doesn't double when you add a whole second layer to the disc. This is 
because when a disc is made with two layers, the pits have to be a little 
longer, on both layers, than when a single layer is used. This helps to avoid 
interference between the layers, which would cause errors when the disc is 
played. </font></p>
<h1 class="articlePageTitle" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">The DVD 
Video Format</font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Even though its storage capacity is huge, 
the uncompressed video data of a full-length movie would never fit on a DVD. In 
order to fit a movie on a DVD, you need <b>video compression</b>. A group called 
the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) establishes the standards for 
compressing moving pictures. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When movies are put onto DVDs, they are 
encoded in MPEG-2 format and then stored on the disc. This compression format is 
a widely accepted international standard. Your DVD player contains an MPEG-2 
decoder, which can uncompress this data as quickly as you can watch it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If an average DVD movie were uncompressed, 
it would take at least a year to download it over a normal phone line. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<font color="#000099">The MPEG-2 Format 
and Data Size Reduction</font><br>
A movie is usually filmed at a rate of 24 frames per second. This means that 
every second, there are 24 complete images displayed on the movie screen. 
American and Japanese television use a format called NTSC, which displays a 
total of 30 frames per second; but it does this in a sequence of 60 fields, each 
of which contains alternating lines of the picture. Other countries use PAL 
format, which displays at 50 fields per second, but at a higher resolution. 
Because of the differences in frame rate and resolution, an MPEG movie needs to 
be formatted for either the NTSC or the PAL system. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The MPEG encoder that creates the 
compressed movie file analyzes each frame and decides how to encode it. The 
compression uses some of the same technology as still image compression does to 
eliminate redundant or irrelevant data. It also uses information from other 
frames to reduce the overall size of the file. Each frame can be encoded in one 
of three ways: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">As an <b>intraframe</b> - An intraframe 
  contains the complete image data for that frame. This method of encoding 
  provides the least compression. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">As a <b>predicted</b> frame - A 
  predicted frame contains just enough information to tell the DVD player how to 
  display the frame based on the most recently displayed intraframe or predicted 
  frame. This means that the frame contains only the data that relates to how 
  the picture has changed from the previous frame. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">As a <b>bidirectional</b> frame - In 
  order to display this type of frame, the player must have the information from 
  the surrounding intraframe or predicted frames. Using data from the closest 
  surrounding frames, it uses interpolation (something like averaging) to 
  calculate the position and color of each pixel. </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Depending on the type of scene being 
converted, the encoder will decide which types of frames to use. If a newscast 
were being converted, a lot more predicted frames could be used, because most of 
the scene is unaltered from one frame to the next. On the other hand, if a very 
fast action scene were being converted, in which things changed very quickly 
from one frame to the next, more intraframes would have to be encoded. The 
newscast would compress to a much smaller size than the action sequence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If all of this sounds complicated, then 
you are starting to get a feeling for how much work your DVD player does to 
decode an MPEG-2 movie. A lot of processing power is required; even some 
computers with DVD players can't keep up with the processing required to play a 
DVD movie. </font></p>

Audio</font></h1>
<!-- dtl_id=21200 //-->
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">DVD audio and DVD video are different 
formats. DVD audio discs and players are relatively rare right now, but they 
will become more common, and the difference in sound quality should be 
noticeable. In order to take advantage of higher-quality DVD audio discs, you 
will need a DVD player with a 192kHz/24-bit digital-to-analog converter (<b>DAC</b>). 
Most DVD players have only a 96kHz/24-bit digital-to-analog converter. So if you 
want to be able to listen to DVD audio discs, be sure to look for a DVD audio 
player with a <b>192kHz/24-bit digital-to-analog converter</b>. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">DVD audio recordings can provide far 
better sound quality than CDs. The chart below lists the sampling rate and 
accuracy for CD recordings and the maximum sampling rate and accuracy for DVD 
recordings. CDs can hold 74 minutes of music. DVD audio discs can hold 74 
minutes of music at their highest quality level, 192kHz/24-bit audio. By 
lowering either the sampling rate or the accuracy, DVDs can be made to hold more 
music. A DVD audio disc can store up to two hours of 6-channel, better than CD 
quality, 96kHz/24-bit music. Lower the specifications further, and a DVD audio 
disc can hold almost seven hours of CD-quality audio. </font></p>

very exciting for true film buffs. DVDs can also contain extra, previously 
unreleased scenes. And a DVD is sometimes a <b>director's cut</b> -- the film as 
the director originally intended it. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If your receiver has its own Dolby Digital 
decoder and DTS decoder, then you don't need a DVD player with 5.1 channel 
outputs, and you can save some money on cables by using the digital outputs.
</font></p>
<h1 class="articlePageTitle" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">The DVD 
Player</font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A DVD player is very similar to a CD 
player. It has a laser assembly that shines the laser beam onto the surface of 
the disc to read the pattern of bumps. The DVD player decodes the MPEG-2 encoded 
movie, turning it into a standard composite video signal . The player also 
decodes the audio stream and sends it to a Dolby decoder, where it is amplified 
and sent to the speakers. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The DVD player has the job of finding and 
reading the data stored as bumps on the DVD. Considering how small the bumps 
are, the DVD player has to be an exceptionally precise piece of equipment. The 
drive consists of three fundamental components: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>A drive motor</b> to spin the disc - 
  The drive motor is precisely controlled to rotate between 200 and 500 rpm, 
  depending on which track is being read. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>A laser and a lens system</b> to 
  focus in on the bumps and read them - The light from this laser has a smaller 
  wavelength (640 nanometers) than the light from the laser in a CD player (780 
  nanometers), which allows the DVD laser to focus on the smaller DVD pits.
  </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>A tracking mechanism</b> that can 
  move the laser assembly so the laser beam can follow the spiral track - The 
  tracking system has to be able to move the laser at micron resolutions. </font>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Inside the DVD player, there is a good bit 
of computer technology involved in forming the data into understandable data 
blocks, and sending them either to the DAC, in the case of audio or video data, 
or directly to another component in digital format, in the case of digital video 
or data. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The fundamental job of the DVD player is 
to focus the laser on the track of bumps. The laser can focus either on the 
semi-transparent reflective material behind the closest layer, or, in the case 
of a double-layer disc, through this layer and onto the reflective material 
behind the inner layer. The laser beam passes through the polycarbonate layer, 
bounces off the reflective layer behind it and hits an opto-electronic device, 
which detects changes in light. The bumps reflect light differently than the 
&quot;lands,&quot; the flat areas of the disc, and the opto-electronic sensor detects that 
change in reflectivity. The electronics in the drive interpret the changes in 
reflectivity in order to read the bits that make up the bytes. </font></p>

</script>
</center>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The hardest part of reading a DVD is 
keeping the laser beam centered on the data track. This centering is the job of 
the <b>tracking system</b>. As the DVD is played, the tracking system has to 
move the laser continually outward. As the laser moves outward from the center 
of the disc, the bumps move past the laser at an increasing speed. This happens 
because the linear, or tangential, speed of the bumps is equal to the radius 
times the speed at which the disc is revolving. So, as the laser moves outward, 
the spindle motor must slow the spinning of the DVD so that the bumps travel 
past the laser at a constant speed, and the data comes off the disc at a 
constant rate. </font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="DVD7.png" width="331" height="210"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">An interesting thing to note is that if a 
DVD has a second layer, the start of that layer's data track can be at the 
outside of the disc instead of the inside. This allows the player to transition 
quickly from one layer to the next, without a delay in data output, because it 
doesn't have to move the laser back to the center of the disc to read the next 
layer. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000099">Supported Formats</font><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>DVD movies</b><br>
  Just about all players play DVD movies. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Music CDs</b> <br>
  Most players also play music CDs. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Video CDs</b> <br>
  Some players can handle this format, which is used mostly for music videos and 
  some movies from foreign countries. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>CD-Rs</b> <br>
  Some players can play content that you create on your own computer. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Audio DVDs</b> <br>
  A few players can handle this format for high-quality audio. </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000099">Other Features</font><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Dolby Digital decoder</b><br>
  This feature allows the DVD player to decode the Dolby Digital information 
  from a DVD and convert it to six separate analog channels. This feature is not 
  necessary if you have a Dolby Digital receiver, which has a digital input that 
  carries all of the audio information. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>DTS decoder</b><br>
  This feature allows the DVD player to decode the DTS information from a DVD 
  and convert it to six separate analog channels. Again, this feature is not 
  necessary if you have a receiver with a DTS decoder. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>DTS compatible</b><br>
  All DVD players are DTS compatible. They pass the digital audio information on 
  to the receiver, which then decodes it. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Simulated surround</b><br>
  If you are going to hook the DVD player up to a TV or a stereo system with 
  only two speakers, a DVD player with simulated surround processing will give 
  you some sense of surround sound without the extra speakers. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Disc capacity</b><br>
  Some DVD players can hold three, five or even several hundred discs. Since 
  most DVD players can also play audio CDs, if you buy a player with a high disc 
  capacity you could store your whole CD collection in the machine. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>96kHz/24-bit DAC</b><br>
  This is the speed and accuracy of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which 
  converts the audio information into an analog signal. Most movie soundtracks 
  are encoded in this format, so this is really a required feature, and most DVD 
  players will have at least a 96kHz/24-bit DAC. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>192kHz/24-bit DAC</b><br>
  This is an upcoming format for audio-only DVDs that are recorded at speeds of 
  up to 192kHz and 24-bits. Only the newest DVD audio players have the 
  192kHz/24-bit DAC required to play these audio discs. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Remote-control type</b><br>
  DVD players may come with three types of remotes: </font>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A <b>dedicated remote</b>, which only 
    runs the DVD player </font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A <b>multibrand remote</b>, which can 
    control other components, like VCRs and TVs made by other manufacturers 
    (Usually, they only support the more common brands.) </font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A <b>learning remote</b>, which can 
    learn the signals from other remotes and assign them to a button (This 
    feature is useful if you have uncommon brands of components to control.)
    </font></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1 class="articlePageTitle" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Outputs</font></h1>
<!-- dtl_id=21206 //-->
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000099">Video Outputs</font><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Component-video outputs</b><br>
  These outputs provide the highest quality video signal to your TV. They are 
  quite rare right now; only the newest high-end TVs can support them. But, if 
  you have such a TV, you'll definitely want a DVD player with component video 
  outputs. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There are three separate connectors for 
  component video output. The player pictured below has one component video 
  output. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial">
  <img border="0" src="DVD8.jpg" width="400" height="242"><br>
  <b>DVD player video outputs from left to right: composite video, s-video, 
  component video</b></font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>S-video outputs</b><br>
  TVs with this type of connection are more common. S-video provides a very good 
  picture quality, and every DVD player has at least one of these outputs. The 
  player pictured above has two of them. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Composite-video outputs</b><br>
  These are the most common type of output, and they provide adequate picture 
  quality. Usually, they have a yellow plastic insert. The player pictured above 
  has two of these outputs. </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000099">Audio Outputs</font><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Coaxial digital output and optical 
  digital output</b><br>
  These outputs provide the highest-quality audio. They send the digital sound 
  information to the receiver for decoding. You can use either one of these if 
  you have a Dolby Digital receiver. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial">

  <b>DVD player audio outputs</b> </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>5.1 channel outputs</b><br>
  5.1 channel is a set of six analog outputs, one for each of the Dolby Digital 
  channels (left front, center front, right front, left rear, right rear and 
  subwoofer). The DVD player decodes the Dolby Digital signal and uses its own 
  DAC to output an analog signal. These are the outputs you'll need to use if 
  you are hooking the DVD player up to a &quot;Dolby Digital ready&quot; receiver. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">DVD players with 5.1 channel outputs 
  will always have Dolby Digital decoders, and they may or may not have DTS 
  decoders. If you have a &quot;Dolby Digital ready&quot; receiver and you want DTS sound, 
  you will need a DVD player with a built-in DTS decoder. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Stereo outputs</b><br>
  These outputs carry only the stereo music signal. You would use these if you 
  were hooking your DVD player up to a TV that has only two speakers. </font>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1 class="articlePageTitle" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">
Connecting the DVD Player</font></h1>
<!-- dtl_id=21208 //-->
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Connecting a DVD player to your stereo 
receiver (or television, if you don't have a receiver) involves making two basic 
connections: audio and video. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Audio</b><br>
The first connection to make is for the audio portion of the signal. There will 
be several options depending on the receiver you have. </font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The best choice (if available) is either 
  to use an <b>optical</b> (also called <b>Tos-link</b>) or <b>coaxial</b> (<b>RCA</b>) 
  digital connection. These two choices are equal in quality. In order to use 
  either of these, you will need to have both an output on the DVD player, and 
  an input on the receiver. Only receivers with <b>built-in Dolby Digital 
  decoders</b> will have this type of input. </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial">
  <img border="0" src="DVD9.jpg" width="400" height="186"><br>
  <b>The audio outputs on a DVD player</b> </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If your receiver does not have a 
  built-in Dolby Digital or DTS decoder, but is <b>&quot;Dolby Digital ready,&quot;</b> 
  look for the <b>5.1-channel Dolby</b> or <b>5.1-channel DTS</b>. This 
  connection involves six cables, corresponding to different speaker channels: 
  left front, center front, right front, left rear, right rear and subwoofer.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The last option to connect the two 
  components is with <b>analog RCA outputs</b>. This is a two-cable connection, 
  with one cable delivering the left speaker sound, and the other cable 
  delivering the right. This connection will deliver only stereo sound, but it 
  may be your only option if you are hooking up directly to a television, or if 
  you have an old receiver with only two channels. </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Now let's take a look at the video 
connection. </font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The best quality choice is to use <b>
  component</b> connection. This connection consists of three cables: 
  color-labeled red, blue and green. The quality is superb. However, these 
  connections only exist on extremely high-end receivers and television sets.
  </font></p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="DVD8.jpg" width="400" height="242"></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>The video outputs on a DVD player</b>
  </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The next option is <b>s-video</b>. One 
  cable connects the DVD player to the receiver in this setup. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The last option, similar to the audio 
  setup, is to use the <b>analog RCA video output</b>, usually color-labeled 
  yellow on both ends. This will deliver the lowest quality, but will suffice 
  for most older, analog televisions. </font></li>
  <li>
  <h1 class="articlePageTitle" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">DVDs 
  and Laser Discs</font></h1>
  <!-- dtl_id=21210 //-->
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Laser disc is an older technology. It 
  offered a better picture and better sound than videotapes, and it is 
  comparable to DVD. But the laser disc format is analog; DVDs are digital. 
  Laser discs are only used for prerecorded movies, and they are larger, about 
  12 inches in diameter, instead the 5-inch diameter of DVDs. The two formats 
  usually can't be played on the same machine. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Laser discs, like DVDs, allow viewers to 
  go to the exact scene they wish to see, and to freeze a frame or slow the 
  picture. Laser discs can only hold an hour on each side, so you have to flip 
  the disc to watch the second half of the movie. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Because of DVD compression techniques, 
  DVDs can hold more data. You rarely have to flip a DVD to watch a whole movie. 
  Laser disc players are noisier than DVD players, and they can sometimes suffer 
  &quot;laser rot&quot; -- the aluminum side of the disc oxidizes, and the quality of the 
  disc deteriorates. DVDs are less likely to have this problem, because 
  manufacturing techniques have improved. As the popularity of DVD grows, laser 
  discs are becoming harder to find. </font></p>

  <font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">FAQ</font></u></h1>
  <!-- dtl_id=21212 //-->
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>What does &quot;DVD&quot; stand for?</b><br>
    &quot;DVD&quot; stands for digital versatile disc, but some sources declare that it 
    doesn't stand for anything anymore. </font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Can I record television shows or 
    movies on a DVD player?</b><br>
    Yes, you can -- if your DVD player is also a DVD recorder. </font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Can I play CDs on a DVD player?</b><br>
    Yes. DVD players are completely compatible with audio compact discs. And 
    music will become increasingly available in DVD format.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>What is the difference between 
    DVD+R and DVD-R?</b><br>
    DVD+ (&quot;plus&quot;) and DVD- (&quot;dash&quot;) are two competing DVD formats. You may 
    remember the &quot;war&quot; between the Betamax and VHS formats for domination of the 
    VCR market. The big difference with DVD+R vs. DVD-R is that there are hybrid 
    (dual-format) drives capable of reading both types. Many companies have 
    taken sides -- the DVD Forum is a group of manufacturers that support DVD-R, 
    while the DVD+RW Alliance supports that format. Consumers have yet to make 
    either format the winner. </font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>What are region codes?</b><br>
    Movie studios use region codes on DVDs to thwart unauthorized copying, and 
    to control the release dates of DVD movies. The actual region code is stored 
    in one byte on the DVD. The DVD player or drive has a region code in its 
    firmware. Personal computer DVD-ROM players often have the code in the 
    software or in the MPEG-2 decoder. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">For the player or drive to play the 
    movie, the two codes must match. The code is also printed on the back of a 
    DVD package, superimposed on a small image of the globe. If you have a DVD 
    that was made for release in Asia, you won't be able to play it on a DVD 
    player intended for use in Australia.</font></li>
