<font size="6" color="#FF0000">Static vs. Dynamic Routing</font></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><strong>

<!-- #EndEditable -->Static Routing </span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Static 
routing</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> is not really a routing 
protocol. Static routing is simply the process of manually entering routes into 
a device's routing table via a configuration file that is loaded when the 
routing device starts up. As an alternative, these routes can be entered by a 
network administrator who configures the routes manually. Since these manually 
configured routes don't change after they are configured (unless a human changes 
them) they are called 'static' routes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Static routing 
is the simplest form of routing, but it is a manual process. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Use static 
routing when you have very few devices to configure (&lt;5) and when you know the 
routes will probably never change. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Static routing 
also does not handle failures in external networks well because any route that 
is configured manually must be updated or reconfigured manually to fix or repair 
any lost connectivity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Dynamic 
Routing </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Dynamic 
routing</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> protocols are supported by 
software applications running on the routing device (the router) which 
dynamically learn network destinations and how to get to them and also advertise 
those destinations to other routers. This advertisement function allows all the 
routers to learn about all the destination networks that exist and how to to 
those networks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">A router</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
using dynamic routing will 'learn' the routes to all networks that are directly 
connected to the device. Next, the router will learn routes from other routers 
that run the same routing protocol (RIP, RIP2, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP etc). 
Each router will then sort through it's list of routes and select one or more 
'best' routes for each network destination the router knows or has learned.
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Dynamic 
routing</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> protocols will then 
distribute this 'best route' information to other routers running the same 
routing protocol, thereby extending the information on what networks exist and 
can be reached. This gives dynamic routing protocols the ability to adapt to 
logical network topology changes, equipment failures or network outages 'on the 
fly'.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">The 
underlying </span><span style="font-family: Arial">difference </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">between dynamic and static 
routing is that static routing is installed manually, while dynamic routing is 
supported by software applications.</span></strong><b><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial">This results in differing 
adaptability and as a consequence different uses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Static 
routing</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> uses a configuration file, 
which is loaded when the router is started up. Because it is manually 
configured, it cannot change after installation unless a person changes it. This 
means that in the event of a failure of the external network, the router must be 
manually updated. Because of this, static routing is best used where there are 
fewer than five devices and the routes are known to be stable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Dynamic 
routers</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> are suitable for use in 
networks where there are multiple routers. Dynamic routing, since it depends on 
software applications, can adapt and learn network destinations both on its own 
and from other routers on the network that are using the same routing protocol. 
As such, dynamic routers can dynamically adapt to changes in the network as well 
as any external network failures.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Modern 
networks</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> typically use a combination 
of both types of routing, with a preference for dynamic routing because of its 
flexibility. Static routing is however more secure and does not include any 
advertising. </span></p>
