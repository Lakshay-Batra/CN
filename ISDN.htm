<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Integrated Services 
Digital Network (ISDN)</span> is comprised of digital telephony and 
data-transport services offered by regional telephone carriers. ISDN involves 
the digitization of the telephone network, which permits voice, data, text, 
graphics, music, video, and other source material to be transmitted over 
existing telephone wires. The emergence of ISDN represents an effort to 
standardize subscriber services, user/network interfaces, and network and 
internetwork capabilities. ISDN applications include high-speed image 
applications (such as Group IV facsimile), additional telephone lines in homes 
to serve the telecommuting industry, high-speed file transfer, and 
videoconferencing. Voice service is also an application for ISDN. This chapter 
summarizes the underlying technologies and services associated with ISDN. </font>

<h2 class="p_H_Head1" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">ISDN Devices
</font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">ISDN devices include 
terminals, terminal adapters (TAs), network-termination devices, 
line-termination equipment, and exchange-termination equipment. ISDN terminals 
come in two types. Specialized ISDN terminals are referred to as terminal 
equipment type 1 (TE1). Non-ISDN terminals, such as DTE, that predate the ISDN 
standards are referred to as terminal equipment type 2 (TE2). TE1s connect to 
the ISDN network through a four-wire, twisted-pair digital link. TE2s connect to 
the ISDN network through a TA. The ISDN TA can be either a standalone device or 
a board inside the TE2. If the TE2 is implemented as a standalone device, it 
connects to the TA via a standard physical-layer interface. Examples include EIA/TIA-232-C 
(formerly RS-232-C), V.24, and V.35. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Beyond the TE1 and TE2 
devices, the next connection point in the ISDN network is the network 
termination type 1 (NT1) or network termination type 2 (NT2) device. These <br>
are network-termination devices that connect the four-wire subscriber wiring to 
the conventional two-wire local loop. In North America, the NT1 is a customer 
premises equipment (CPE) device. In most other parts of the world, the NT1 is 
part of the network provided by the carrier. The NT2 is a more complicated 
device that typically is found in digital private branch exchanges (PBXs) and 
that performs Layer 2 and 3 protocol functions and concentration services. An 
NT1/2 device also exists as a single device that combines the functions of an 
NT1 and an NT2. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">ISDN specifies a number 
of reference points that define logical interfaces between functional groups, 
such as TAs and NT1s. ISDN reference points include the following: </font></p>
<p class="pBu1_Bullet1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">•<img height="2" src="blank.gif" width="19" border="0"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal">R—</span>The 
reference point between non-ISDN equipment and a TA. </font></p>
<p class="pBu1_Bullet1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">•<img height="2" src="blank.gif" width="19" border="0"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal">S—</span>The 
reference point between user terminals and the NT2. </font></p>
<p class="pBu1_Bullet1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">•<img height="2" src="blank.gif" width="19" border="0"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal">T—</span>The 
reference point between NT1 and NT2 devices. </font></p>
<p class="pBu1_Bullet1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">•<img height="2" src="blank.gif" width="19" border="0"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal">U—</span>The 
reference point between NT1 devices and line-termination equipment in the 
carrier network. The U reference point is relevant only in North America, where 
the NT1 function is not provided by the carrier network. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Figure 12-1 illustrates 
a sample ISDN configuration and shows three devices attached to an ISDN switch 
at the central office. Two of these devices are ISDN-compatible, so they can be 
attached through an S reference point to NT2 devices. The third device (a 
standard, non-ISDN telephone) attaches through the reference point to a TA. Any 
of these devices also could attach to an NT1/2 device, which would replace both 
the NT1 and the NT2. In addition, although they are not shown, similar user 
stations are attached to the far-right ISDN switch. </font></p>

<h2 class="p_H_Head1" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Services
</font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">There are two types of 
services associated with ISDN: </font></p>
<p class="pBu1_Bullet1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">•<img height="2" src="blank.gif" width="19" border="0">BRI
</font></p>
<p class="pBu1_Bullet1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">•<img height="2" src="blank.gif" width="19" border="0">PRI
</font></p>
<h3 class="p_H_Head2" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">ISDN BRI 
Service </font></h3>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The ISDN Basic Rate 
Interface (BRI) service offers two B channels and one D channel (2B+D). BRI 
B-channel service operates at 64 kbps and is meant to carry user data; BRI 
D-channel service operates at 16 kbps and is meant to carry control and 
signaling information, although it can support user data transmission under 
certain circumstances. The D channel signaling protocol comprises Layers 1 
through 3 of the OSI reference model. BRI also provides for framing control and 
other overhead, bringing its total bit rate to 192 kbps. <br>
The BRI physical layer specification is International Telecommunication 
Union-Telecommunications Standards Section (ITU-T) (formerly the Consultative 
Committee for International Telegraph and Telephone [CCITT]) I.430. </font></p>
<h3 class="p_H_Head2" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">ISDN PRI 
Service </font></h3>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">ISDN Primary Rate 
Interface (PRI) service offers 23 B channels and 1 D channel in North America 
and Japan, yielding a total bit rate of 1.544 Mbps (the PRI D channel runs at 64 
kbps). ISDN PRI in Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world provides 30 B 
channels plus one 64-kbps D channel and a total interface rate of 2.048 Mbps. 
The PRI physical layer specification is ITU-T I.431. </font></p>
<h2 class="p_H_Head1" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">ISDN

<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">This section describes 
the various ISDN specifications for Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3. </font></p>

</h3>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">ISDN physical layer 
(Layer 1) frame formats differ depending on whether the frame is outbound (from 
terminal to network) or inbound (from network to terminal). Both physical layer

<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The frames are 48 bits 
long, of which 36 bits represent data. The bits of an ISDN physical layer frame 
are used as follows: </font></p>

Physical Layer Frame Formats Differ Depending on Their Direction</font></p>

<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Multiple ISDN user 
devices can be physically attached to one circuit. In this configuration, 
collisions can result if two terminals transmit simultaneously. Therefore, ISDN 
provides features to determine link contention. When an NT receives a D bit from 
the TE, it echoes back the bit in the next E-bit position. The TE expects the 
next E bit to be the same as its last transmitted D bit. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Terminals cannot 
transmit into the D channel unless they first detect a specific number of ones 
(indicating &quot;no signal&quot;) corresponding to a pre-established priority. If the TE 
detects a bit in the echo (E) channel that is different from its D bits, it must 
stop transmitting immediately. This simple technique ensures that only one 
terminal can transmit its D message at one time. After successful D-message 
transmission, the terminal has its priority reduced by requiring it to detect 
more continuous ones before transmitting. Terminals cannot raise their priority 
until all other devices on the same line have had an opportunity to send a D 
message. Telephone connections have higher priority than all other services, and 
signaling information has a higher priority than nonsignaling information.
</font></p>
<h3 class="p_H_Head2" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Layer 2 </font>
</h3>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Layer 2 of the ISDN 
signaling protocol is Link Access Procedure, D channel (LAPD). LAPD is similar 
to High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) and Link Access Procedure, Balanced (LAPB) 
(see Chapter 16, &quot;Synchronous Data Link Control and Derivatives,&quot; and Chapter 
17, &quot;X.25,&quot; for more information on these protocols). As the expansion of the 
LAPD acronym indicates, this layer is used across the D channel to ensure that 
control and signaling information flows and is received properly. The LAPD frame 
format (see Figure 12-3) is very similar to that of HDLC; like HDLC, LAPD uses 
supervisory, information, and unnumbered frames. The LAPD protocol is formally 
specified in ITU-T Q.920 and ITU-T Q.921. </font></p>
<p class="pTC_TableCap" align="center"><font face="Arial">Figure&nbsp;12-3 LAPD Frame 
Format Is Similar to That of HDLC and LAPB</font></p>

  <font face="Arial">
  <img id="wp1020601" height="287" hspace="0" src="ct841203.jpg" width="552" border="0"></font></div>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The LAPD Flag and 
Control fields are identical to those of HDLC. The LAPD Address field can be 
either 1 or 2 bytes long. If the extended address bit of the first byte is set, 
the address is 1 byte; if it is not set, the address is 2 bytes. The first 
Address-field byte contains the service access point identifier (SAPI), which 
identifies the portal at which LAPD services are provided to Layer 3. The C/R 
bit indicates whether the frame contains a command or a response. The Terminal 
Endpoint Identifier (TEI) field identifies either a single terminal or multiple 
terminals. A TEI of all ones indicates a broadcast. </font></p>
<h3 class="p_H_Head2" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Layer 3 </font>
</h3>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Two Layer 3 
specifications are used for ISDN signaling: ITU-T (formerly CCITT) I.450 (also 
known as ITU-T Q.930) and ITU-T I.451 (also known as ITU-T Q.931). Together, 
these protocols support user-to-user, circuit-switched, and packet-switched 
connections. A variety of call-establishment, call-termination, information, and 
miscellaneous messages are specified, including SETUP, CONNECT, RELEASE, USER 
INFORMATION, CANCEL, STATUS, and DISCONNECT. These messages are functionally 
similar to those provided by the X.25 protocol (see Chapter 17 for more 
information). Figure 12-4, from ITU-T I.451, shows the typical stages of an ISDN 
circuit-switched call. </font></p>
