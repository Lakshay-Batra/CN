INTERNET PROTOCOL</font></b></u></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Serial Line IP (SLIP), documented in RFC 
1055, was the first protocol for relaying IP packets over dial-up lines. It 
defines an encapsulation mechanism, but little else. There is no support for 
dynamic address assignment, link testing, or multiplexing different protocols 
over a single link. SLIP has been largely supplanted by PPP.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) 
is a mostly obsolete encapsulation of the Internet Protocol designed to work 
over serial ports and modem connections. It is documented in RFC 1055. On PCs, 
SLIP has been largely replaced by the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which is 
better engineered, has more features and does not require its IP address 
configuration to be set before it is established. On microcontrollers, however, 
SLIP is still the preferred way of encapsulating IP packets due to its very 
small overhead.<br>
SLIP modifies a standard Internet datagram by appending a special &quot;SLIP END&quot; 
character to it, which allows datagrams to be distinguished as separate. SLIP 
requires a port configuration of 8 data bits, no parity, and either EIA hardware 
flow control, or CLOCAL mode (3-wire null-modem) UART operation settings.<br>
SLIP does not provide error detection, being reliant on other higher-layer 
protocols for this. Therefore SLIP on its own is not satisfactory over a 
particularly error-prone dial-up connection. It is however still useful for 
testing OS' real-time capabilities under load (by looking at flood-ping 
statistics).<br>
A version of SLIP with header compression is called CSLIP (Compressed SLIP).<br>
SLIP is also currently used in the BlueCore Serial Protocol for communication 
between Bluetooth modules and host computers.<br>
