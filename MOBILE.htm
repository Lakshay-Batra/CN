Communications</b></font></span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="text3"><font size="3" face="Arial">
<b>Mobile Communications: </b>Electromagnetic waves were first discovered as a 
communications medium at the end of the 19th century. The first systems offering 
mobile telephone service (car phone) were introduced in the early 1950s. Those 
early single cell systems were severely constrained by restricted mobility, low 
capacity, limited service, and poor speech quality. The equipment was heavy, 
bulky, expensive, and susceptible to interference. Because of those limitations, 
less than one million subscribers were registered worldwide by the early 1980s.</font></span><font size="3"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3"><b>First Generation (1G): Analog 
Cellular</b><br>
The introduction of cellular systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
represented a quantum leap in mobile communication (especially in capacity and 
mobility). Semiconductor technology and microprocessors made smaller, lighter 
weight, and more sophisticated mobile systems a practical reality for many more 
users. These 1G cellular systems still transmit only analog voice information. 
The most prominent 1G systems are Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), Nordic 
Mobile Telephone (NMT), and Total Access Communication System (TACS). With the 
1G introduction, the mobile market showed annual growth rates of 30 to 50 
percent, rising to nearly 20 million subscribers by 1990.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3"><b>Second Generation (2G): Multiple 
Digital Systems</b><br>
The development of 2G cellular systems was driven by the need to improve 
transmission quality, system capacity, and coverage. Further advances in 
semiconductor technology and microwave devices brought digital transmission to 
mobile communications. Speech transmission still dominates the airways, but the 
demands for fax, short message, and data transmissions are growing rapidly. 
Supplementary services such as fraud prevention and encrypting of user data have 
become standard features that are comparable to those in fixed networks. 2G 
cellular systems include GSM, Digital AMPS (D-AMPS), code division multiple 
access (CDMA), and Personal Digital Communication (PDC). Today, multiple 1G and 
2G standards are used in worldwide mobile communications. Different standards 
serve different applications with different levels of mobility, capability, and 
service area (paging systems, cordless telephone, wireless local loop, private 
mobile radio, cellular systems, and mobile satellite systems). Many standards 
are used only in one country or region, and most are incompatible. GSM is the 
most successful family of cellular standards (GSM900, GSM–railway [GSM–R], 
GSM1800, GSM1900, and GSM400), supporting some 250 million of the world’s 450 
million cellular subscribers with international roaming in approximately 140 
countries and 400 networks.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3"><b>2G to 3G: GSM Evolution</b><br>
Phase 1 of the standardization of GSM900 was completed by the European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 1990 and included all necessary 
definitions for the GSM network operations. Several tele-services and bearer 
services have been defined (including data transmission up to 9.6 kbps), but 
only some very basic supplementary services were offered. As a result, GSM 
standards were enhanced in Phase 2 (1995) to incorporate a large variety of 
supplementary services that were comparable to digital fixed network integrated 
services digital network (ISDN) standards. In 1996, ETSI decided to further 
enhance GSM in annual Phase 2+ releases that incorporate 3G capabilities.</span>
<span class="text3">GSM Phase 2+ releases have introduced important 3G features 
such as intelligent network (IN) services with customized application for mobile 
enhanced logic (CAMEL), enhanced speech compression/decompression (CODEC), 
enhanced full rate (EFR), and adaptive multirate (AMR), high–data rate services 
and new transmission principles with high-speed circuit-switched data (HSCSD), 
general packet radio service (GPRS), and enhanced data rates for GSM evolution 
(EDGE). UMTS is a 3G GSM successor standard that is downward-compatible with GSM, 
using the GSM Phase 2+ enhanced core network.</span> <span class="text3">IMT–2000<br>
The main characteristics of 3G systems, known collectively as IMT–2000, are a 
single family of compatible standards that have the following characteristics:</span>

  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">Used worldwide </span></font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">Used for all mobile applications
  </span></font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">Support both packet-switched (PS) 
  and circuit-switched (CS) data transmission </span></font></li>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">Offer high data rates up to 2 Mbps 
  (depending on mobility/velocity) </span></font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">Offer high spectrum efficiency</span>
  </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">IMT–2000 is a set of requirements 
defined by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). As previously 
mentioned, IMT stands for International Mobile Telecommunications, and “2000” 
represents both the scheduled year for initial trial systems and the frequency 
range of 2000 MHz (WARC’92: 1885–2025 MHz and 2110–2200 MHz). All 3G standards 
have been developed by regional standards developing organizations (SDOs). In 
total, proposals for 17 different IMT–2000 standards were submitted by regional 
SDOs to ITU in 1998—11 proposals for terrestrial systems and 6 for mobile 
satellite systems (MSSs). Evaluation of the proposals was completed at the end 
of 1998, and negotiations to build a consensus among differing views were 
completed in mid 1999. All 17 proposals have been accepted by ITU as IMT–2000 
standards. The specification for the Radio Transmission Technology (RTT) was 
released at the end of 1999.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">The most important IMT–2000 proposals 
are the UMTS (W-CDMA) as the successor to GSM, CDMA2000 as the interim standard 
’95 (IS–95) successor, and time division–synchronous CDMA (TD–SCDMA) (universal 
wireless communication–136 [UWC–136]/EDGE) as TDMA–based enhancements to D–AMPS/GSM—all 
of which are leading previous standards toward the ultimate goal of IMT–2000.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">UMTS allows many more applications to 
be introduced to a worldwide base of users and provides a vital link between 
today’s multiple GSM systems and IMT–2000. The new network also addresses the 
growing demand of mobile and Internet applications for new capacity in the 
overcrowded mobile communications sky. UMTS increases transmission speed to 2 
Mbps per mobile user and establishes a global roaming standard.</span> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">UMTS is being developed by 
Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a joint venture of several SDOs—ETSI 
(Europe), Association of Radio Industries and Business/Telecommunication 
Technology Committee (ARIB/TTC) (Japan), American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) T-1 (USA), telecommunications technology association (TTA) (South Korea), 
and Chinese Wireless Telecommunication Standard (CWTS) (China). To reach global 
acceptance, 3GPP is introducing UMTS in phases and annual releases. The first 
release (UMTS Rel. ’99), introduced in December of 1999, defines enhancements 
and transitions for existing GSM networks. For the second phase (UMTS Rel. ’00), 
similar transitions are being proposed as enhancements for IS–95 (with CDMA2000) 
and TDMA (with TD–CDMA and EDGE).</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="text3">The most significant change in Rel. 
’99 is the new UMTS terrestrial radio access (UTRA), a W–CDMA radio interface 
for land-based communications. UTRA supports time division duplex (TDD) and 
frequency division duplex (FDD). The TDD mode is optimized for public micro and 
pico cells and unlicensed cordless applications. The FDD mode is optimized for 
wide-area coverage, i.e., public macro and micro cells. Both modes offer 
flexible and dynamic data rates up to 2 Mbps. Another newly defined UTRA mode, 
multicarrier (MC), is expected to establish compatibility between UMTS and 
CDMA2000.</span> </font></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><span class="head"><font size="3">The Cell Approach</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="3" face="Arial">One of the most interesting things about a cell phone is that it is really a 
radio -- an extremely sophisticated radio, but a radio nonetheless. The 
telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, and wireless 
communication can trace its roots to the invention of the radio by Nikolai Tesla 
in the 1880s (formally presented in 1894 by a young Italian named Guglielmo 
Marconi). It was only natural that these two great technologies would eventually 
be combined! </font><font size="3"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the dark ages before cell phones, people who really 
needed mobile communications ability installed radio telephones in their cars. 
In the radio telephone system, there was one central antenna tower per city, and 
perhaps 25 channels available on that tower. This central antenna meant that the 
phone in your car needed a powerful transmitter -- big enough to transmit 40 or 
50 miles. It also meant that not many people could use radio telephones -- there 
just were not enough channels. </font></p>
<p align="justify"></font><font size="3" face="Arial">The genius of the cellular system is the 
division of a city into small cells. This allows extensive frequency reuse 
across a city, so that millions of people can use cell phones simultaneously. In 
a typical analog cell phone system in the United States, the cell phone carrier 
receives about 800 frequencies to use across the city. The carrier chops up the 
city into cells. Each cell is typically sized at about 10 square miles (26 
square kilometers). Cells are normally thought of as hexagons on a big hexagonal 
grid, like this: </font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="MOBILE1.jpg" width="444" height="380"></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Each cell has a base station that consists of a tower and 
a small building containing the radio equipment. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A single cell in an analog system uses one-seventh of the 
available duplex voice channels. That is, one cell, plus the six cells around it 
on the hexagonal grid, are each using one-seventh of the available channels so 
that each cell has a unique set of frequencies and there are no collisions:
</font></p>
<li>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A cell phone carrier typically gets 832 radio frequencies 
to use in a city. </font></li>
<li>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Each cell phone uses two frequencies per call -- a duplex 
channel -- so there are typically 395 voice channels per carrier. (The other 42 
frequencies are used for control channels). </font></li>
<li>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Therefore, each cell has 56 or so voice channels 
available. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In other words, in any cell, 56 people can be talking on 
their cell phones at one time. With digital transmission methods, the number of 
available channels increases. For example, a TDMA-based digital system can carry 
three times as many calls as an analog system, so each cell would have about 168 
channels available. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Cell phones have low-power transmitters in them. Many cell 
phones have two signal strengths: 0.6 watts and 3 watts (for comparison, most CB 
radios transmit at 4 watts). The base station is also transmitting at low power. 
Low-power transmitters have two advantages: </font></li>
<li>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The transmissions of a base station and the phones within 
its cell do not make it very far outside that cell. Therefore, in the figure 
above, both of the purple cells can reuse the same 56 frequencies. The same 
frequencies can be reused extensively across the city. </font></li>
<li></font>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">The power consumption of the cell phone, 
which is normally battery-operated, is relatively low. Low power means small 
batteries, and this is what has made handheld cellular phones possible.</font></li></p>
