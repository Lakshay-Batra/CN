Wireless Security </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;There are two approaches commonly used at 
Rutgers: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">1.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>WPA or possibly WEP for access 
control and some level of privacy; supplemented by end to end encryption for 
privacy </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">2.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>End to end encryption (typically 
SSL) for privacy, and special gateway systems for access control (see below) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Generally small 
installations use the first approach with WPA in &quot;personal&quot; mode, and larger 
ones the second approach. While it is not common at Rutgers, 
another possible approach for larger installations would be to use WPA in 
&quot;enterprise&quot; mode. (However there is a significant user support implication to 
that, because WPA in enterprise mode requires all of your users to have 802.1x 
supplicant software on their systems and know how to use it.) </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">This document will present WPA, then end to 
end encryption, and finally the services appropriate for larger installations. 
If you are planning to set up something for yourself or a few people in a 
department, we recommend reading about WPA and end to end encryption. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">A few installations use MAC address checks 
for access control and end to end encryption for privacy. While this probably 
meets the requirements of the Wireless policy, we do not recommend it. Managing 
MAC addresses is difficult. It's generally better to use one of the two 
approaches listed above. </span></p>
<p class="Heading23" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: 700">WPA and WEP </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">WPA and WEP are technologies that &quot;encrypt&quot; 
the traffic on your network. That is, they scramble it so that an attacker can't 
make any sense of it. To unscramble it at the other end, all systems using it 
must know a &quot;key&quot; or password. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Note that WPA is now in a second generation, 
referred to as WPA2. Unless otherwise specified, this document uses &quot;WPA&quot; to 
refer to both. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">WPA and WEP provide both access control and 
privacy. Privacy comes from the encryption. Access control comes from the fact 
that someone must know the password to use your network. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">For this reason, for small networks, using 
WPA is enough to meet the requirements of the Wireless policy. However you will 
still want to make sure that any services that use a password or other private 
information use SSL or some other type of end to end encryption. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">WEP is significantly less secure than WPA, 
but can be used until your equipment can be upgraded to support WPA. While WEP 
is widely regarded as insecure, it is still a lot better than nothing. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">WPA has two modes, personal and enterprise. 
For small installations you'll want to use personal mode. It just requires a 
password. Enterprise mode is for larger installations, that have a Radius server 
that will support WPA. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The primary problem with WPA in personal 
mode is that it has a single password, which you must tell to all users. That 
becomes impractical for larger installations. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">WPA in enterprise mode requires each user to 
login with their own username and password. That simplifies management in large 
installations, because you don't have to distribute a common password to all 
your users. However it is a bit more complex to implement: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">·</span></font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">Each user's system must have special 
software to let the user login to the network. This software is referred to as 
an &quot;802.1x supplicant&quot;. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">·</span></font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">The access point must support WPA 
enterprise mode. The access point is configured to talk to a RADIUS server, 
which is a central server that actually checks the password. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">·</span></font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">You must have a RADIUS server that 
supports WPA enterprise mode. While the RADIUS server may have its own list of 
usernames and passwords, it would be more common for it to talk to an LDAP or 
Active Directory server, so that users login to the network with the same 
password that they use for other services. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">For this reason, most large implementations 
at Rutgers do not use enterprise mode. Instead they use separate gateway boxes 
for access control, and depend upon end to end encryption for privacy. One can 
argue that this is not as secure as WPA enterprise mode, but it avoids the 
support implications of requiring users to login to the network with an 802.1x 
supplicant. </span></p>
<p class="Heading34" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Choosing 
a good password </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">It is critical to use a good password. There 
are attacks against WPA that will break your security if your password uses 
words or any other well-known sequences. WPA allows passwords as long as 63 
characters. We strongly recommend using a long random password, or at the very 
least a long phrase (at least 20 characters, but preferably longer). The phrase 
should not be taken from any web site or published work. Most software saves the 
password, so you only need to type it once on each system. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Even better than a long phrase is a truly 
random password. This generates a random 32-character hex string. You can 
combine two of them (and leave off one character) to get a 63-character 
password. </span></p>
<p class="Heading34" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">
Background </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">WEP &quot;Wireless Equivalent Privacy&quot; was part 
of the original wireless specifications, so almost all hardware supports it. 
Unfortunately it is also fairly insecure. Hackers can easily find out the 
password and then do anything they want with your network. The software for 
doing this is widely available. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">WPA &quot;Wifi Protected Access&quot; is a modified 
version of WEP, which changes the effective key quite often. It is much more 
secure than WEP. While there are theoretical attacks, it is currently believed 
that they are not practical <b>as long as you use a good password </b>. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">As of Sept 31, 2003, all new 802.11b and g 
hardware that is tested for Wi-Fi certification must implement WPA. Thus WPA 
should now be fairly widely available. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">WPA2 is a second-generation implementation, 
based on new encryption technology. The original WPA used the WEP encryption, 
improved by frequent key changes. In contrast, WPA2 is based on new encryption 
technology, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Certification for WPA2 
started in September, 2004. As of March 13, 2006, all equipment using the WiFi 
trademark must be certified for WPA2. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">It is possible to mix WPA and WPA2 clients 
on a single network. As long as the access point supports WPA2 mixed mode, 
systems that support WPA2 will use AES and older systems will use WPA (except 
for broadcast or multicast traffic). </span></p>
<p class="Heading34" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Other 
common precautions </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">There are two other security precautions 
available in most wireless hardware: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">·</span></font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">MAC address control </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">·</span></font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">disabling SSID broadcast </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">MAC address control is a feature -- 
available on most access points -- that causes the access point only to talk to 
specific wireless devices. Each device (e.g. the wireless card that you put in 
your laptop) has a &quot;MAC address&quot; assigned to it. This address should be shown on 
the card. It will be a 12-digit hex number. Sometimes it is shown with 
punctuation, e.g. 00:07:50:03:6b:c0. 
Other times it is simply 12 hex digits, e.g. 000750036bc0. You register this 
address with the access point. The access point will only talk to cards that are 
registered. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">In my opinion this is not necessary if you 
are using WPA with reasonably good passwords, at least not if you have just a 
few users. If you have a large user community, your password is likely to get 
out. For larger installations, we recommend a gateway box with login controls 
rather than MAC address control. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;SSID&quot; is the technical term for the network 
name. You enter this into the access point when you set it up. (Don't leave the 
name as the default, or you are likely to conflict with other access points in 
your area. Normally you use your name or some name associated with your 
department.) Access points normally advertise this name by broadcasting it 
regularly. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">This broadcast is used by people as a 
starting point to find networks to attack. For that reason, most access points 
let you turn off broadcast of the SSID. Often this is called making it a &quot;closed 
network.&quot; In theory, closed networks are more secure, because an attacker won't 
notice them. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">However in practice it is probably not a 
good idea. First, hacker software has other ways of locating closed networks. 
Anyone who can break WEP or WPA will be using tools that do not depend upon SSID 
broadcasts. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Second, disabling SSID broadcasts makes it 
more difficult for other people to set up and manage nearby networks. It's 
useful to see how many networks are operating on each channel, without having to 
go to hacker tools. </span></p>
<p class="Heading23" align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">End to 
end encryption: SSL, SSH, etc</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The approaches described in the previous 
section all work at the network level. That is, they are based on features of 
the network cards and access points. This is extremely useful protection, 
particluarly if you can use WPA or WPA2. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">However most security experts believe that 
encrypting at the network level isn't enough. Thus we strongly urge you to use 
end to end encryption. In fact our larger installations depend upon end to end 
encryption, and do not use WPA. (However they then need a separate method to 
control access.) </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">End to end encrytion means that the whole 
conversation is encrypted, from your PC to the service you talking to. The most 
commonly used end to end encryption is SSL. As long as you are using SSL to talk 
to a web server, your conversation is private. It doesn't matter whether someone 
can watch your wireless network. They won't be able to make sense of what they 
are seeing, because it is encrypted. It is possible to use SSL with other 
services such as email. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">SSH is another common end to end method of 
encryption. SSH is often used as a replacement for telnet: there are SSH clients 
that let you log into systems just as telnet would. The difference is that the 
SSH connection is encrypted. SSH can also be used with other services, such as 
copying files (a replacement for FTP in many circumstances). </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Thus one way to deal with the privacy 
problem is to make sure that users only use services that are secured with SSL, 
SSH, or some other encryption technology. In particular, you would need to make 
sure that any service that requires a password uses encryption. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">While possible, this solution is going to 
require great care. You will need to </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">1.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Examine every network service 
used by your users </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">2.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Verify that they can all be 
accessed using a secure protocol such as SSL and SSH </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">3.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Verify that your users have 
configured their systems to use the secure protocol. (In many cases access is 
insecure by default -- users need to enable encryption.) </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">OIT has largely finished this process for 
its public services. As of July, 2003, all email and web services using the 
standard Rutgers password must be handled using SSL or SSH. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">However if you are going to depend upon end 
to end encryption, you will need to implement similar precautions for your 
departmental services, and any other services used by your users. </span></p>
<p class="Heading34" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: 700">Using Valid Certificates
</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">If you are going to depend upon end to end 
encryption, you will need to caution users to pay attention to security 
warnings. As noted above, it is particularly easy to impersonate a well-known 
server on a wireless network, or to do what is called a &quot;man in the middle 
attack.&quot; The best protection against this is the fact that SSH and SSL use 
digital certificates to verify the identify of the server. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Unfortunately the user has to pay attention 
in order to get the benefits of this protection. If you are talking to a fake 
server, the user will normally see an error message saying that there is 
something wrong with the certificate presented by the server. If users commonly 
click through error messages, they may end up talking to a rogue server. That 
server can then steal their password. If the rogue server passes the transaction 
through to the real server, the user may never know that their password has been 
stolen. More ambitious attacks could steal any information that the user has 
access to, and even change data on servers. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">If we're going to ask users to start paying 
attention to messages about certificates, this means we are going to have to 
start using valid certificates on all servers. Currently OIT buys commercial 
certificates from Verisign or Thawte for our major servers. However experimental 
or small-scale services may use &quot;self-signed&quot; certificates. These certificates 
will generate warning messages. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">We suggest that all areas of the University 
use commercial certificates for any service that is going to be used widely, 
particularly by wireless users. As an alternative, you may ask the RULink 
Project to sign a certificate request for you. But if you do this, you'll need 
to make sure that your users load the RULink Project CA Certificate. </span></p>
<p class="Heading23" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: 700">Access control </span></font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Access control means limiting who can use 
your network. This is important for two primary reasons: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">·</span></font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">If others are using your network, it is 
likely to be slower for your authorized users. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">·</span></font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">The University periodically receives 
reports of abuse from systems on the network. E.g. someone may be sending spam 
or threatening email. Those reports will be sent to department that operates the 
network from which the problem originated. If you don't have any way to limit 
access to your network, you have no way to know who might have done it, nor any 
way to prevent reoccurrence. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">WPA is intended primarily to protect 
privacy. However it also provides a reasonable degree of access control, as long 
as you have few enough users that you can control who has access to the 
password, or you use WPA in enterprise mode. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">For larger installations, we suggest using a 
wireless gateway, or WPA operating in enterprise mode. Both of these require the 
user to login before they get access. Both let you use departmental accounts or 
the Rutgers NetID. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Wireless gateways are boxes placed between 
the wireless network and the rest of RUNet. They keep track of active users (by 
MAC address), and require a login for a new user. Normally they use a web 
interface. They trap attempts to access any web site, and put up a login screen.
</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Rutgers uses two different types of wireless 
gateway: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">·</span></font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">Bluesocket systems </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">·</span></font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial">Linux systems using special-purpose 
software, such as the system from the New Brunswick computer science department
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Both provide essentialy 
the same features, although the Bluesocket systems are easier to manage. The OIT 
campus divisions are prepared to provide Bluesocket-based service to any 
department that needs it, on a contract basis. </span></p>
<p class="Heading23" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: 700">Basic security </span></font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The discussion above has focused on issues 
that are specific to wireless technology. You also need to make sure that all 
systems you use have good basic security. If you are using general-purpose 
systems (e.g. Windows or Linux) in any part of your infrastructure, they need to 
be hardened. If you are using &quot;appliances&quot; or other sorts of dedicated hardware, 
look carefully at their security. Do they have any remote management, e.g. a web 
interface? If so, make sure you change any default passwords, and restrict 
access as much as possible (e.g. just to workstations from which you will 
actually be doing management, if this is possible). </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">These days even access points are 
&quot;intelligent&quot;, so you need to do the same kind of security checks that you would 
with any other component. Make sure you have complete documentation for all ways 
to manage your access points. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Many devices, including both access points 
and appliances, permit management using SNMP (Simple Network Management 
Protocol). This is a standard protocol for managing a variety of devices. There 
are common tools for dealing with SNMP devices. SNMP management has both good 
points and dangers. You can sometimes do things using SNMP that you can't using 
the vendor's GUI interface. E.g. with some products you can disable SSID 
broadcasts using SNMP but not with their normal interface. However SNMP is also 
a security issue: it is often shipped using a default password. When you are 
changing passwords, make sure you change the SNMP password (often called the 
&quot;community&quot;) as well as the more visible ones. Indeed I would normally disable 
SNMP unless I'm actually using it. </span></p>
<p class="Heading23" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: 700">VPNs </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Unfortunately SSL and SSH are not yet 
sufficiently widespread that we can be sure all activity is covered by one or 
the other of them. Another approach is to use VPN (&quot;virtual private network&quot;) 
technology. This creates another layer of networking on top of the wireless 
network. This layer is encrypted. Because VPNs are implemented in software (at 
least on the user's end), they are independent of any weaknesses in the network 
technology, and they can be used with any vendor's network cards. Windows and 
several other operating systems come with the software needed to use a VPN. 
However you will need to supply something on the other end. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">There are similarities between SSL/SSH and a 
VPN: both encrypt your communications. The difference is that SSL and SSH are 
used for individual connections. E.g. when you are talking to a web server using 
SSL, the specific connection between you and the web server is encrypted using 
SSL. With a VPN, all of your traffic goes through a single encrypted connection. 
If every service you talk to supports SSL or SSH, the result is the same. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">A typical VPN setup will look like this:

<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The two vertical lines 
represent wired networks. The one on the left is a normal departmental network, 
part of RUnet. The one to its right is the wireless support network, a separate 
wired network or VLAN used just to connect access points. Its only connection to 
RUnet is through the VPN box. The wireless access points are connected to that 
wireless support network. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">In order to access any system at Rutgers 
or the Internet, users must first establish a VPN connection to the box. Once 
the VPN is established, all of their communcations are encrypted. In fact all of 
their communications go over a single connection to the VPN box. That box then 
separates out the various connections and sends them to appropriate places 
within RUnet or the Internet. Because all access to RUnet goes through the VPN 
box, intruders can't access RUnet. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The VPN box should be configured so that 
users must establish a VPN from their laptop to it. In the process of 
establishing the VPN, they need a username and a password. Thus this approach 
deals with both access and privacy issues. It deals with access issues, because 
users must specify a username and password in order to establish the VPN. It 
deals with privacy issues because all traffic is encrypted. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The significant drawbacks to VPNs are </span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">1.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>All users will need to set up VPN 
software. This may require significant user support. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 75.0pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">2.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are situations where this 
approach is probably not practical. The primary one involves guests. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">If you take this approach, 
you need to think about how you will handle guests. E.g. if you host a 
conference, and attendees expect to use laptops, it may not be practical to get 
all of them to set up VPN software. You may also have people from other 
institutions that need to access their home institutions using a corporate 
firewall. It is normally not practical to use two VPN's at once. So if someone 
needs to use VPN software to get into their home network, they probably will not 
be able to use your wireless VPN. For these reasons people implementing this 
approach should plan on having the ability for selected users to bypass the VPN. 
However this bypass needs to be controlled so that normal Rutgers 
users don't use it. Otherwise their passwords will be compromised. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">During 2003, OIT implemented wireless 
networking in a number of locations using hardware from Bluesocket. This 
hardware was configured to require all connections to use a VPN. Unfortunately, 
we found that there were serious problems configuring client software to use the 
VPN's. We have run into endless configuration and compatibility problems. Thus 
as of late October, 2003, we made VPN use optional. We suspect most users will 
not enable it. Thus OIT will be relying upon end to end encryption for privacy, 
and on the login system implemented by the Bluesocket systems for access 
control. </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: 700">Summary </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Note that every one of the alternatives 
below has a significant requirement for user support. If you are going to use 
wireless networking, you need to be prepared for this. In evaluating 
network-related hardware. 1. If you currently have a network with no security at 
all, the easiest thing for you to do is to enable WPA or WEP. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">There is a significant support implication 
to this approach: you will need to make sure that all users have the proper key 
or password configured on their system. If you also restrict on the basis of NIC 
address, you will need to maintain a list of NIC addresses of every one of your 
users. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">2. For larger installations, we recommend 
putting a wireless gateway between your wireless network and the rest of the 
network, or using WPA in Enterprise 
mode. Note however that WPA in enterprise mode will require all users to have 
and know how to use 801.1x supplicant software. We do not yet have enough 
experience to know how practical this is. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">3. In either case, we recommend making sure 
that all services you provide to users are protected by end to end encryption (SSL, 
ssh, etc). This is required if you use the Rutgers NetID and password for the 
service.&nbsp;</span></p>
