<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">As a result of research done 
at Xerox Corporation in the early 1970s, Ethernet has evolved into the most 
widely implemented networking protocol today. Fast Ethernet increased speed from 
10 to 100 megabits per second (Mbit/s). Gigabit Ethernet was the next iteration, 
increasing the speed to 1000 Mbit/s. The initial standard for Gigabit Ethernet 
was standardized by the IEEE in June 1998 as IEEE 802.3z. 802.3z is commonly 
referred to as 1000BASE-X (where -X refers to either -CX, -SX, -LX, or 
(non-standard) -ZX).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Gigabit 
Ethernet, a transmission technology based on the Ethernet frame format and 
protocol used in local area networks (LANs), provides a data rate of 1 billion 
bits per second (one gigabit). Gigabit Ethernet is defined in the IEEE 802.3 
standard and is currently being used as the backbone in many enterprise 
networks. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Gigabit Ethernet is carried 
primarily on optical fiber (with very short distances possible on copper media). 
Existing Ethernet LANs with 10 and 100 Mbps cards can feed into a Gigabit 
Ethernet backbone. An alternative technology that competes with Gigabit Ethernet 
is ATM. A newer standard, 10-Gigabit Ethernet, is also becoming available</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) is a 
term describing various technologies for transmitting Ethernet packets at a rate 
of a gigabit per second, as defined by the IEEE 802.3-2002 standard.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">IEEE 802.3ab, ratified in 
1999, defines Gigabit Ethernet transmission over unshielded twisted pair (UTP) 
category 5, 5e, or 6 cabling and became known as 1000BASE-T. With the 
ratification of 802.3ab, Gigabit ethernet became a desktop technology as 
organizations could utilize their existing copper cabling infrastructure.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Initially, Gigabit Ethernet 
was deployed in high-capacity backbone network links (for instance, on a 
high-capacity campus network). In 2000, Apple's Power Mac G4 and PowerBook G4 
were the first mass produced personal computers featuring the 1000BASE-T 
connection. It has since become a built-in feature in many Macintoshes and PCs.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Fiber Gigabit Ethernet has 
recently been overtaken by 10 Gigabit Ethernet which was ratified by the IEEE in 
2002 and provided data rates 10 times greater than that of Gigabit Ethernet. 
Work on copper 10 Gigabit Ethernet over twisted pair has just been completed, 
but as of June 2006, the only currently available adapters for 10 gigabit 
Ethernet over copper requires special cabling and is limited to 15 m.</span></p>

There are four different physical layer standards for Gigabit Ethernet using 
optical fiber, twisted pair cable, or balanced copper cable.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The IEEE 802.3z standard 
includes 1000BASE-SX transmission over multi-mode fiber, 1000BASE-LX 
transmission over single-mode fiber, and the now obsolete 1000BASE-CX for 
transmission over balanced copper cabling. These standards use 8B/10B encoding, 
inflating the line rate by 25%, from 1000 Mbit/s to 1250 Mbit/s. (Note that 
8B/10B is an encoding scheme, not a specific code - there exist multiple 
incompatible implementations; for a specific one, see the standard.) The symbols 
are then sent using NRZ, as 8B/10B mapping already handles the DC balancing 
properties of the signal (compare to 1000BASE-T).</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">IEEE 802.3ab defines 
1000BASE-T.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">1000BASE-SX</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">1000BASE-SX is a fiber optic 
Gigabit Ethernet standard. It operates over multi-mode fiber using a 850 
nanometer, near infrared (NIR) light wavelength. The specification allows for a 
maximum distance between endpoints of 220 m over 62.5/125 µm fibre although in 
practice, with good quality fibre and terminations, 1000BASE-SX will usually 
work over significantly longer distances. Modern 50/125 µm fibres can reliably 
extend the signal to 500 m or more. This standard is highly popular for 
intra-building links in large office buildings, colocation facilities and 
carrier neutral internet exchanges.</span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">1000BASE-LX</font></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">1000BASE-LX is a fiber optic 
Gigabit Ethernet standard, using a long wavelength laser (See IEEE 802.3 Clause 
38). Signaling speed 1.25±100 ppm GBd, wavelength 1270 to 1355 nm, RMS spectral 
width (max) 4 nm. Typically, GbE lasers will be specified as having a 1300 or 
1310 nm wavelength.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">1000BASE-LX is specified to 
work over a distance of up to 2 km over 9 µm single-mode fiber. In practice it 
will often operate correctly over a much greater distance. Many manufacturers 
will guarantee operation up to 10 or 20 km, provided that their equipment is 
used at both ends of the link. 1000BASE-LX can also run over multi-mode fiber 
with a maximum segment length of 550 m. For any link distance greater than 300 
m, the use of a special launch conditioning patch-cord may be required. This 
launches the laser at a precise offset from the center of the fiber which causes 
it to spread across the diameter of the fiber core. This reduces the effect 
known as differential mode delay which occurs when the laser couples onto only a 
small number of available modes in multi-mode fiber.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family:Arial">1000BASE-CX</span></b></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">1000BASE-CX is an obsolete 
standard for Gigabit Ethernet connections over short distances (maximum of 25 
meters per segment) using copper cable (balanced shielded twisted pair). It was 
succeeded by 1000BASE-T.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family:Arial">1000BASE-T</span></b></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">1000BASE-T (also known as 
IEEE 802.3ab) is a standard for Gigabit Ethernet over copper wiring. It 
requires, at a minimum, Category 5 cable (the same as 100BASE-TX), but Category 
5e (&quot;Category 5 enhanced&quot;) and Category 6 cable may also be used and is often 
recommended. 1000BASE-T requires all four pairs to be present and is far less 
tolerant of poorly installed wiring than 100BASE-TX.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Each network segment can have 
a maximum distance of 100 meters, although several chip manufacturers claim 150 
meters. Auto negotiation is a requirement for using 1000BASE-T[1].</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">In a departure from both 
10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T uses all four cable pairs for simultaneous 
transmission in both directions through the use of echo cancellation and a 
5-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-5) technique. The symbol rate is 
identical to that of 100BASE-TX (125 MBd) and the noise immunity of the 5-level 
signaling is also identical to that of the 3-level signaling in 100BASE-TX, 
since 1000BASE-T uses 4-Dimensional Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) to achieve a 
6 dB coding gain across the 4 pairs.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The data is transmitted over 
four copper pairs, 8 bits per symbol. First, an 8-bit symbol is expanded into 
four 3-bit symbols through a non-trivial scrambling procedure based on a linear 
feedback shift register; this is similar to what is done in 100BASE-T2, but uses 
different parameters. Example symbol mapping to PAM-5 during test pattern 
transmission goes like this (generally, mapping is non-constant and fast 
varying):</span></p>

<h2 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">1000BASE-TX</font></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) created and promoted a version 
of 1000BASE-T that was simpler to implement, calling it 1000BASE-TX. The 
simplified design would, in theory, have reduced the cost of the required 
electronics by only using two pair in each direction. However, the two-pair 
solution required Category 6 cable and has been a commercial failure, likely due 
to the rapidly falling cost of 1000BASE-T products combined with the Category 6 
cable requirement. Many 1000BASE-T products are advertised as 1000BASE-TX due to 
lack of knowledge that 1000BASE-TX is actually a different standard.</font></p>
