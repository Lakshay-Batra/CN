<b><font color="#FF0000" size="6">pROXY SERVER</font></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">A server that sits 
between a client application such as a Web browser, and a real server. It 
intercepts all requests to the real server to see if it can fulfill the requests 
itself. If not, it forwards the request to the real server. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Proxy servers have two main purposes:
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">·</span><font face="Arial">&nbsp; <b>Improve 
Performance:</b> Proxy servers can dramatically improve performance for groups 
of users. This is because it saves the results of all requests for a certain 
amount of time. Consider the case where both user X and user Y access the World 
Wide Web through a proxy server. First user X requests a certain Web page, which 
we'll call Page 1. Sometime later, user Y requests the same page. Instead of 
forwarding the request to the Web server where Page 1 resides, which can be a 
time-consuming operation, the proxy server simply returns the Page 1 that it 
already fetched for user X. Since the proxy server is often on the same network 
as the user, this is a much faster operation. Real proxy servers support 
hundreds or thousands of users. The major online services such as America 
Online, MSN and Yahoo, for example, employ an array of proxy servers. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">·</span><font face="Arial">&nbsp; <b>Filter 
Requests:</b> Proxy servers can also be used to filter requests. For example, a 
company might use a proxy server to prevent its employees from accessing a 
specific set of Web sites. </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial">A
<b>proxy server</b> is a computer that offers a computer network service to 
allow clients to make indirect network connections to other network services. A 
client connects to the proxy server, then requests a connection, file, or other 
resource available on a different server. The proxy provides the resource either 
by connecting to the specified server or by serving it from a cache. In some 
cases, the proxy may alter the client's request or the server's response for 
various purposes, usually to view websites normally not allowed, such as game or 
pornography site at work or school.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="text-transform: uppercase"><b><span class="hw">proxy server:</span>
</b></span>Also called a &quot;proxy,&quot; it is a computer system or router that breaks 
the connection between sender and receiver. Functioning as a relay between 
client and server, proxy servers are used to help prevent an attacker from 
invading the private network. Proxies are one of several tools used to build a 
firewall. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The word proxy means &quot;to act on behalf of 
another,&quot; and a proxy server acts on behalf of the client and the server. All 
requests from the clients to the Internet go to the proxy server first. The 
proxy evaluates them, and if allowed, re-establishes the requests on the 
outbound side to the Internet. Likewise, responses or initial requests coming 
from the Internet go to the proxy server to be evaluated. The proxy then talks 
to the client. Both client and server think they are communicating with one 
another, but, in fact, are dealing only with the proxy. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Address Translation and Caching</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The proxy server is a dual-homed host with 
two network interfaces and two IP addresses. The IP address on the outbound side 
of the proxy is the one the Internet sees, and the address of the machine making 
the request is hidden to the outside world. Proxies are often used in 
conjunction with network address translation (NAT), which hides all the IP 
addresses of the client machines on the internal network. Proxy servers may also 
cache Web pages, so that the next request for that same page can be obtained 
much faster locally. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><span class="shw">Application Level and 
Circuit Level</span><br>
</b><br>
Proxy servers are available for common Internet services; for example, an HTTP 
proxy is used for Web access; an FTP proxy is used for file transfers. Such 
proxies are called &quot;application-level&quot; proxies or &quot;application-level gateways,&quot; 
because they are dedicated to a particular application and protocol and are 
aware of the content of the packets being sent. A generic proxy, called a 
&quot;circuit-level&quot; proxy, supports multiple applications. For example, SOCKS is a 
generic IP-based proxy server that supports TCP and UDP applications.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><span class="shw">Other Proxies</span></b><br>
<br>
Without being called a proxy specifically, the Internet's e-mail system (SMTP) 
is an example of a proxy server because it stores and forwards messages. E-mail 
is not sent directly from client to client without going through the mail 
server. Likewise, the Internet's Usenet news system (NNTP) forwards messages to 
neighboring servers.</font></p>

<span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN">Types</span></span></font></h2>
<h3 style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">
<span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN">Web</span></span></font></h3>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Proxies that attempt to block offensive web content are 
implemented as web proxies. Other web proxies reformat web pages for a specific 
purpose or audience; for example, Skweezer reformats web pages for cell phones 
and PDAs. Network operators can also deploy proxies to intercept computer 
viruses and other hostile content served from remote web pages.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">A special case of web proxies are &quot;CGI proxies.&quot; These are web 
sites that allow a user to access a site through them. They generally use PHP or 
CGI to implement the proxying functionality. CGI proxies are frequently used to 
gain access to web sites blocked by corporate or school proxies. Since they also 
hide the user's own IP address from the web sites they access through the proxy, 
they are sometimes also used to gain a degree of anonymity, called &quot;Proxy 
Avoidance.&quot;</span></font></p>
<font color="#000000">
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">SSL</font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A growing subset of Web traffic uses HTTPS 
to create an encrypted tunnel. Regulations often require all Intranet and ASP 
applications handling sensitive data to use encryption. Traditional (HTTP) 
proxies can not cache encrypted traffic, hence provide no acceleration, control 
or bandwidth savings for SSL applications.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Some HTTPS Proxies are specifically 
designed to operate in the middle of a client-server communication to decrypt, 
apply policy, cache and re-encrypt SSL traffic. As a result, these HTTPS Proxies 
can monitor, control and accelerate SSL traffic. These HTTPS Proxies can also 
apply malware scanning and content filtering to inhibit phishing, spyware and 
computer viruses hiding inside encrypted tunnels.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There are privacy concerns with SSL 
proxies. In essence, the IT department is conducting a Man-in-the-middle attack, 
potentially exposing sensitive corporate information, personal online banking 
information, etc. Countries such as Sweden have very strong privacy laws, which 
may require the proxy to handle corporate information with different policy than 
personal traffic.In Sweden, privacy laws apply to non-SSL proxies too. <i>
Personuppgiftslagen</i> (PUL, a Swedish privacy law) doesn't differ between 
encrypted and unencrypted data. But as long as no details about the identity of 
the user is stored or collected, PUL doesn't apply, and unrestricted scanning of 
SSL information is allowed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Content filtering can differentiate this 
traffic. Additional compromise policy options include caching GIF and JPEG 
objects (which typically are user interface elements and lack confidential 
data), but exclude from caching HTML and TXT traffic.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Sometimes the term &quot;SSL proxy&quot; also refers 
to CGI web proxies that are accessible via encrypted SSL connections. In this 
case, SSL adds an extra layer of security on top of the CGI proxy system, 
lessening the chance of data interception.</font></p>

<h3 style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">
<span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN">Intercepting</span></span></font></h3>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Many organizations — including corporations, schools, and 
families — use a proxy server to enforce acceptable network use policies or to 
provide security, anti-malware and/or caching services. A traditional web proxy 
is not transparent to the client application, which must be configured to use 
the proxy (manually or with a configuration script). In some cases, where 
alternative means of connection to the Internet are available (e.g. a SOCKS 
server or NAT connection), the user may be able to avoid policy control by 
simply resetting the client configuration and bypassing the proxy. Furthermore 
administration of browser configuration can be a burden for network 
administrators.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">An <b>intercepting proxy</b>, often incorrectly called <i>
transparent proxy</i> (also known as a forced proxy) combines a proxy server 
with NAT. Connections made by client browsers through the NAT are intercepted 
and redirected to the proxy without client-side configuration (or often 
knowledge).</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Intercepting proxies are commonly used in businesses to prevent 
avoidance of acceptable use policy, and to ease administrative burden, since no 
client browser configuration is required.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Intercepting proxies are also commonly used by Internet Service 
Providers in many countries in order to reduce upstream link bandwidth 
requirements by providing a shared cache to their customers.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">It is often possible to detect the use of an intercepting proxy 
server by comparing the external IP address to the address seen by an external 
web server, or by examining the HTTP headers on the server side.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Some poorly implemented intercepting proxies have historically 
had certain downsides, e.g. an inability to use user authentication if the proxy 
does not recognize that the browser was not intending to talk to a proxy. </span>

request or response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and

<span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN">Open</span></span></font></h3>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">An <b>open proxy</b> is a proxy server which will accept client 
connections from any IP address and make connections to any Internet resource. 
Abuse of open proxies is currently implicated in a significant portion of e-mail 
spam delivery. <i>Spammers</i> frequently install open proxies on unwitting end 
users' operating systems by means of computer viruses designed for this purpose. 
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) abusers also frequently use open proxies to cloak 
their identities.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Because proxies might be used for abuse, system administrators 
have developed a number of ways to refuse service to open proxies. IRC networks 
such as the Blitzed network automatically test client systems for known types of 
open proxy. Likewise, an email server may be configured to automatically test 
e-mail senders for open proxies, using software such as Michael Tokarev's </span>
</font><code style="font-family: Arial"><span lang="EN">proxycheck</span></code><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">Groups of IRC and electronic mail operators run DNSBLs 
publishing lists of the IP addresses of known open proxies, such as AHBL, CBL, 
NJABL, and SORBS.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">The ethics of automatically testing clients for open proxies are 
controversial. Some experts, such as Vernon Schryver, consider such testing to 
be equivalent to an attacker portscanning the client host. Others consider the 
client to have solicited the scan by connecting to a server whose terms of 
service include testing.</span></font></p>

<span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN">Reverse</span></span></font></h3>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">A <b>reverse proxy</b> is a proxy server that is installed in 
the neighborhood of one or more web servers. All traffic coming from the 
Internet and with a destination of one of the web servers goes through the proxy 
server. There are several reasons for installing reverse proxy servers:</span></font></p>

<span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN">Split</span></span></font></h3>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">A <b>split proxy</b> is effectively a pair of proxies installed 
across two computers. Since they are effectively two parts of the same program, 
they can communicate with each other in a more efficient way than they can 
communicate with a more standard resource or tool such as a website or browser. 
This is ideal for compressing data over a slow link, such as a wireless or 
mobile data service and also for reducing the issues regarding high latency 
links (such as satellite internet) where establishing a TCP connection is time 
consuming. Taking the example of web browsing, the user's browser is pointed to 
a local proxy which then communicates with its other half at some remote 
location. This remote server fetches the requisite data, repackages it and sends 
it back to the user's local proxy, which unpacks the data and presents it to the 
browser in the standard fashion .</span></font></p>
<font color="#000000">
<h2 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Circumventor</font></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A <b>circumventor</b> is a web-based page 
that takes a site that is blocked and &quot;circumvents&quot; it through to an unblocked 
website, allowing the user to view blocked pages. A famous example is '<i><b>elgoog'</b></i>, 
which allowed users in China to use Google after it had been blocked there. 
Elgoog differs from most circumventors in that it circumvents only one block.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The most common use is in schools where 
many blocking programs block by site rather than by code; students are able to 
access blocked sites (games, chat rooms, messenger, pornography, weapons, 
racism, forbidden knowledge, etc.) through a circumventor. As fast as the 
filtering software blocks circumventors, others spring up. It should be noted, 
however, that in some cases the filter may still intercept traffic to the 
circumventor, thus the person who manages the filter can still see the sites 
that are being visited.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Circumventors are also used by people who 
have been blocked from a website.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Another use of a circumventor is to allow 
access to country-specific services, so that Internet users from other countries 
may also make use of them. An example is country-restricted reproduction of 
media and webcasting.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The use of circumventors is usually safe 
with the exception that circumventor sites run by an untrusted third party can 
be run with hidden intentions, such as collecting personal information, and as a 
result users are typically advised against running personal data such as credit 
card numbers or passwords through a circumventor.</font></p>
