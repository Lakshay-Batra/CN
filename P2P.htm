<p class="Normal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Networks can allow 
computers, servers, and other devices to talk to each other. There are a number 
of different types of networks, and it's important to find the right one to fit 
your needs so that you don't waste time and money with one that is too complex 
for your needs, or one that doesn't fulfill your needs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you only need to share a printer or an 
Internet connection, a client-server network might be overkill. Sometimes, a 
simpler peer-to-peer network may be all you need. The diagram below shows a

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">As you can see from the diagram, in a 
peer-to-peer network there are no dedicated servers or hierarchy among the 
computers. All of the computers on the network handle security and 
administration for themselves. The users must make the decisions about who gets 
access to what. Beyond that there are more similarities between the types of 
network than differences. All of the computers must have network cards. You also 
use the same cables, the same hubs and switches, and the same protocols as you 
would with a client-server model. The only difference is that there isn't a 
server. Since there isn't a server, there are some things to think about before 
you go down the peer-to-peer path.</font></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">April 08, 2002 </span></b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">-- In its simplest form, a 
peer-to-peer (P2P) network is created when two or more PCs are connected and 
share resources without going through a separate server computer. A P2P network 
can be an ad hoc connection—a couple of computers connected via a Universal 
Serial Bus to transfer files. A P2P network also can be a permanent 
infrastructure that links a half-dozen computers in a small office over copper 
wires. Or a P2P network can be a network on a much grander scale in which 
special protocols and applications set up direct relationships among users over 
the Internet. </span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The initial use of P2P networks 
in business followed the deployment in the early 1980s of free-standing PCs. In 
contrast to the minimainframes of the day, such as the VS system from Wang 
Laboratories Inc., which served up word processing and other applications to 
dumb terminals from a central computer and stored files on a central hard drive, 
the then-new PCs had self-contained hard drives and built-in CPUs. The smart 
boxes also had onboard applications, which meant they could be deployed to 
desktops and be useful without an umbilical cord linking them to a mainframe.
</span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Many workers felt liberated by 
having dedicated PCs on their desktops. But soon they needed a way to share 
files and printers. The obvious solution was to save files to a floppy disk and 
carry the disk to the intended recipient or send it by interoffice mail. </span>
</p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Sneaker Nets</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
</span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">That practice resulted in the 
term &quot;sneaker net.&quot; The most frequent endpoint of a typical sneaker net was the 
worker who had a printer connected to his machine. </span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">While sneaker nets seemed an odd 
mix of the newest technology and the oldest form of transportation, the model is 
really the basis for today's small P2P workgroups. </span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Whereas earlier centralized 
computing models and today's client/server systems are generally considered 
controlled environments in which individuals use their PCs in ways determined by 
a higher authority, a classic P2P workgroup network is all about openly sharing 
files and devices. </span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">In general, office and home P2P 
networks operate over Ethernet (10M bit/sec.) or Fast Ethernet (100M bit/sec.) 
and employ a hub-and-spoke topology. Category 5 (twisted-pair) copper wire runs 
among the PCs and an Ethernet hub or switch, enabling users of those networked 
PCs access to one another's hard drives, printers or perhaps a shared Internet 
connection. </span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Both Client and Server</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
</span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">In effect, every connected PC is 
at once a server and a client. There's no special network operating system 
residing on a robust machine that supports special server-side applications like 
directory services (specialized databases that control who has access to what).
</span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">In a P2P environment, access 
rights are governed by setting sharing permissions on individual machines.
</span></p>
<p style="background: white" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">For example, if User A's PC is 
connected to a printer that User B wants to access, User A must set his machine 
to allow (share) access to the printer. Similarly, if User B wants to have 
access to a folder or file, or even a complete hard drive, on User A's PC, User 
A must enable file sharing on his PC. Access to folders and printers on an 
office P2P network can be further controlled by assigning passwords to those 
resources. </span></p>

<font size="3">Peer-to-peer Architecture</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3"><br>
Often referred to simply as peer-to-peer, or abbreviated P2P, peer-to-peer 
architecture is a type of network in which each workstation has equivalent 
capabilities and responsibilities. This differs from client/server architectures 
where some computers are dedicated to serving the others. Peer-to-peer networks 
are generally simpler but they usually do not offer the same performance under 
heavy loads. The P2P network itself relies on computing power at the ends of a 
connection rather than from within the network itself. </font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">P2P is often 
mistakenly used as as a term to describe one user linking with another user to 
transfer information and files through the use of a common P2P client to 
download MP3s, videos, images, games and other software. This, however, is only 
one type of P2P networking. Generally, P2P networks are used for sharing files, 
but a&nbsp; P2P network can also mean Grid Computing or Instant messaging.</font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">Types of 
P2P Networks<br>
</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">Peer-to-peer 
networks come in three flavors. The category classification is based on the 
network and application.</font></span><font size="3" face="Arial"> </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">
Collaborative Computing</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3"><br>
Also referred to as distributed computing, it combines the idle or unused CPU 
processing power and/or free disk space of many computers in the network. 
Collaborative computing is most popular with science and biotech organizations 
where intense computer processing is required. Examples of distributed computing 
can be found at
<a href="http://www.grid.org" style="color: #000099; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none">
GRID.ORG</a> where United Devices is hosting virtual screening for cancer 
research on the Grid MP platform. This project has evolved into the largest 
computational chemistry project in history. United Devices has harnessed the 
power of more than 2,000,000 PCs around the world to generate more than 100 
teraflops of power. Most distributed computing networks are created by users 
volunteering their unused computing resources to contribute to public interest 
research projects.</font></span><font size="3" face="Arial"> </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">Instant 
Messaging</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3"><br>
One very common form of P2P networking is Instant Messaging (IM) where software 
applications, such as MSN Messenger or AOL Instant Messenger, for example, allow 
users to chat via text messages in real-time. While most vendors offer a free 
version of their IM software others have begun to focus on enterprise versions 
of IM software as business and corporations have moved towards implementing IM 
as a standard communications tool for business.</font></span><font size="3" face="Arial">

Affinity Communities</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3"><br>
Affinity communities is the group of P2P networks that is based around 
file-sharing and became widely known and talked about due to the public legal 
issues surrounding the direct file sharing group, Napster. Affinity Communities 
are based on users collaborating and searching other user's computers for 
information and files.</font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">How 
Peer-to-peer File-sharing Clients Work</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3"><br>
Once you have downloaded and installed a P2P client, if you are connected to the 
Internet you can launch the utility and you are then logged into a central 
indexing server. This central server indexes all users who are currently online 
connected to the server. This server does not host any files for downloading. 
The P2P client will contain an area where you can search for a specific file. 
The utility queries the index server to find other connected users with the file 
you are looking for. When a match is found the central server will tell you 
where to find the requested file. You can then choose a result from the search 
query and your utility when then attempt to establish a connection with the 
computer hosting the file you have requested. If a successful connection is 
made, you will begin downloading the file. Once the file download is complete 
the connection will be broken.</font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">A second 
model of P2P clients works in the same way but without a central indexing 
server.&nbsp; In this scenario the P2P software simply seeks out other Internet users 
using the same program and informs them of your presence online, building a 
large network of computers as more users install and use the software. </font>
</span></p>
<p align="justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">P2P 
Security Concerns</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3"><br>
One major concern of using P2P architecture in the workplace is, of course, 
network security. Security concerns stem from the architecture itself. Today we 
find most blocking and routing handles by a specific server within network, but 
the P2P architecture has no single fixed server responsible for routing and 
requests. The first step in securing your P2P network is to adopt a strict usage 
policy within the workplace. In securing your network against attacks and 
viruses there are two main strategies where focus is on controlling the network 
access or the focus is put on controlling the files. A protocol-based approach 
is where system administrators use a software or hardware solution to watch for 
and block intrusive network traffic being received through the P2P clients. A 
second method of protection is a software solution which would provide file 
surveillance to actively search for files based on their type, their name, their 
signature or even their content. </font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">P2P at 
Work</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3"><br>
P2P is not only popular with home users but many small business have come to 
rely on this cost-effective solution for sharing files with co-workers and 
clients. P2P promotes the ease of working together when you're not physically 
located in the same office. In just seconds updated files and data can be shared 
with peers and confidential files can be blocked for security. Additionally, 
companies can also block access to Internet music and video files to assist in 
maintaining a work-oriented P2P network. Not only does this keep the company 
free and clear from legal issues regarding music downloading and sharing but it 
also keeps the corporate bandwidth usage down.</font></span><font size="3" face="Arial">
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A <b>peer-to-peer</b> (or <b>P2P</b>) 
computer network is a network that relies primarily on the computing power and 
bandwidth of the participants in the network rather than concentrating it in a 
relatively low number of servers. P2P networks are typically used for connecting 
nodes via largely <i>ad hoc</i> connections. Such networks are useful for many 
purposes. Sharing content files (see file sharing) containing audio, video, data 
or anything in digital format is very common, and real-time data, such as 
telephony traffic, is also passed using P2P technology.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A pure peer-to-peer network does not have 
the notion of clients or servers, but only equal <i>peer</i> nodes that 
simultaneously function as both &quot;clients&quot; and &quot;servers&quot; to the other nodes on 
the network. This model of network arrangement differs from the client-server 
model where communication is usually to and from a central server. A typical 
example for a non peer-to-peer file transfer is an FTP server where the client 
and server programs are quite distinct, and the clients initiate the 
download/uploads and the servers react to and satisfy these requests.</font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">Operation of peer-to-peer 
networks</font></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">One possible classification of 
peer-to-peer networks is according to their degree of centralisation:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Pure peer-to-peer:</font></p>
<ul lastCheckbox="null">
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Peers act as equals, merging the roles 
  of clients and server </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There is no central server managing the 
  network </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There is no central router </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Hybrid peer-to-peer:</font></p>
<ul lastCheckbox="null">
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Has a central server that keeps 
  information on peers and responds to requests for that information. </font>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Peers are responsible for hosting 
  available resources (as the central server does not have them), for letting 
  the central server know what resources they want to share, and for making its 
  shareable resources available to peers that request it. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Route terminals are used addresses, 
  which are referenced by a set of indices to obtain an absolute address. </font>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Some examples of &quot;pure&quot; peer-to-peer 
application layer networks designed for file sharing are Gnutella and Freenet.</font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">Advantages of peer-to-peer 
networks</font></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">An important goal in peer-to-peer networks 
is that all clients provide resources, including bandwidth, storage space, and 
computing power. Thus, as nodes arrive and demand on the system increases, the 
total capacity of the system also increases. This is not true of a client-server 
architecture with a fixed set of servers, in which adding more clients could 
mean slower data transfer for all users.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The distributed nature of peer-to-peer 
networks also increases robustness in case of failures by replicating data over 
multiple peers, and -- in pure P2P systems -- by enabling peers to find the data 
without relying on a centralized index server. In the latter case, there is no 
single point of failure in the system.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When the term peer-to-peer was used to 
describe the Napster network, it implied that the peer protocol was important, 
but, in reality, the great achievement of Napster was the empowerment of the 
peers (i.e., the fringes of the network) in association with a central index, 
which made it fast and efficient to locate available content. The peer protocol 
was just a common way to achieve this.</font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">Unstructured and structured P2P 
networks</font></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The P2P overlay network consists of all 
the participating peers as network nodes. There are links between any two nodes 
that know each other: i.e. if a participating peer knows the location of another 
peer in the P2P network, then there is a directed edge from the former node to 
the latter in the overlay network. Based on how the nodes in the overlay network 
are linked to each other, we can classify the P2P networks as unstructured or 
structured.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">An unstructured P2P network is formed when 
the overlay links are established arbitrarily. Such networks can be easily 
constructed as a new peer that wants to join the network can copy existing links 
of another node and then form its own links over time. In an unstructured P2P 
network, if a peer wants to find a desired piece of data in the network, the 
query has to be flooded through the network in order to find as many peers as 
possible that share the data. The main disadvantage with such networks is that 
the queries may not always be resolved. A popular content is likely to be 
available at several peers and any peer searching for it is likely to find the 
same, but, if a peer is looking for a rare or not-so-popular data shared by only 
a few other peers, then it is highly unlikely that search be successful. Since 
there is no correlation between a peer and the content managed by it, there is 
no guarantee that flooding will find a peer that has the desired data. Flooding 
also causes a high amount of signalling traffic in the network and hence such 
networks typically have a very poor search efficiency. Most of the popular P2P 
networks such as Napster, Gnutella and KaZaA are unstructured.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Structured P2P networks overcome the 
limitations of unstructured networks by maintaining a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) 
and by allowing each peer to be responsible for a specific part of the content 
in the network. These networks use hash functions and assign values to every 
content and every peer in the network and then follow a global protocol in 
determining which peer is responsible for which content. This way, whenever a 
peer wants to search for some data, it uses the global protocol to determine the 
peer(s) responsible for the data and then directs the search towards the 
responsible peer(s). Some well known structured P2P networks are:</font></p>
