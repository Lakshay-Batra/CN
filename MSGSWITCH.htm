<h1><font face="Arial">Message Switching</font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Message Switching:</b> A method of handling message traffic through a switching center, 
either from local users or from other switching centers, whereby the message 
traffic is stored and forwarded through the system.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Sometimes there is no need for a
circuit to be established all the way from the source to the destination. 
Consider a connection between the users (A and D) in the figure below (i.e. A 
and D) is represented by a series of links (AB, BC, and CD).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><i>A connection between two systems A &amp; D 
formed from 3 links</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">For instance, when a telex (or email) message is sent from 
A to D, it first passes over a local connection (AB). It is then passed at some 
later time to C (via link BC), and from there to the destination (via link CD). 
At each message switch, the received message is stored, and a connection is 
subsequently made to deliver the message to the neighboring message switch. 
Message switching is also known as store-and-forward switching since the 
messages are stored at intermediate nodes en route to their destinations.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><i>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><i>The use of message switching to 
communicate between A and D</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The figure illustrates message switching; transmission of 
only one message is illustrated for simplicity. As the figure indicates, a 
complete message is sent from node A to node B when the link interconnecting 
them becomes available. Since the message may be competing with other messages 
for access to facilities, a queuing delay may be incurred while waiting for the 
link to become available. The message is stored at B until the next link becomes 
available, with another queuing delay before it can be forwarded. It repeats 
this process until it reaches its destination.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Circuit setup delays are replaced by queuing delays. 
Considerable extra delay may result from storage at individual nodes. A delay 
for putting the message on the communications link (message length in bits 
divided by link speed in bps) is also incurred at each node en route. Message 
lengths are slightly longer than they are in circuit switching, after 
establishment of the circuit, since header information must be included with 
each message; the header includes information identifying the destination as 
well as other types of information.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Most message switched networks do not use dedicated 
point-to-point links and therefore a call must be set-up using a
circuit switched network. The figure below illustrates the use of message 
switching over a circuit switched network, in this case using one intermediate 
message switch.</font></p>
