<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Short for <b><i>e</i></b><i>lectronic <b>
mail</b>, </i>the transmission of messages over communications networks. The 
messages can be notes entered from the keyboard or electronic files stored on 
disk. Most mainframes, minicomputers, and computer networks have an e-mail 
system. Some electronic-mail systems are confined to a single computer system or 
network, but others have gateways to other computer systems, enabling users to 
send electronic mail anywhere in the world. Companies that are fully 
computerized make extensive use of e-mail because it is fast, flexible, and 
reliable. </font></p>
<p nd="2" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Most e-mail systems include a 
rudimentary text editor for composing messages, but many allow you to edit your 
messages using any editor you want. You then send the message to the recipient 
by specifying the recipient's address. You can also send the same message to 
several users at once. This is called <i>broadcasting</i>. </font></p>
<p nd="3" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Sent messages are stored in 
electronic mailboxes until the recipient fetches them. To see if you have any 
mail, you may have to check your electronic mailbox periodically, although many 
systems alert you when mail is received. After reading your mail, you can store 
it in a text file, forward it to other users, or delete it. Copies of memos can 
be printed out on a printer if you want a paper copy. </font></p>
<p nd="4" align="justify"><font face="Arial">All online services and Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs) offer e-mail, and most also support gateways so that 
you can exchange mail with users of other systems. Usually, it takes only a few 
seconds or minutes for mail to arrive at its destination. This is a particularly 
effective way to communicate with a group because you can broadcast a message or 
document to everyone in the group at once. </font></p>
<p nd="5" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Although different e-mail systems 
use different formats, there are some emerging standards that are making it 
possible for users on all systems to exchange messages. In the PC world, an 
important e-mail standard is MAPI. The CCITT standards organization has 
developed the X.400 standard, which attempts to provide a universal way of 
addressing messages. To date, though, the de facto addressing standard is the 
one used by the Internet system because almost all e-mail systems have an 
Internet gateway. </font></p>
<h3 align="justify">&nbsp;</h3>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">Origins of e-mail</span></font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">E-mail predates the Internet; existing e-mail systems were 
a crucial tool in creating the Internet. MIT first demonstrated the Compatible 
Time-Sharing System (CTSS) in 1961. It allowed multiple users to log into the 
IBM 7094 from remote dial-up terminals, and to store files online on disk. This 
new ability encouraged users to share information in new ways. E-mail started in 
1965 as a way for multiple users of a time-sharing mainframe computer to 
communicate. Although the exact history is murky, among the first systems to 
have such a facility were SDC's Q32 and MIT's CTSS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">E-mail was quickly extended to become <i>network e-mail</i>, 
allowing users to pass messages between different computers. The messages could 
be transferred between users on different computers by 1966, but it is possible 
the SAGE system had something similar some time before.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The ARPANET computer network made a large contribution to 
the evolution of e-mail. There is one report which indicates experimental 
inter-system e-mail transfers on it shortly after its creation, in 1969. Ray 
Tomlinson initiated the use of the @ sign to separate the names of the user and 
their machine in 1971. The ARPANET significantly increased the popularity of 
e-mail, and it became the killer app of the ARPANET.</font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">How 
Internet e-mail works</span></font></h3>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The diagram above shows a typical sequence 
of events that takes place when Alice composes a message using her mail user 
agent (MUA). She types in, or selects from an address book, the <b>e-mail 
address</b> of her correspondent. She hits the &quot;send&quot; button.</font></p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Her MUA formats the message in Internet 
  e-mail format and uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send the 
  message to the local mail transfer agent (MTA), in this case </font><tt>
  <font face="Arial">smtp.a.org</font></tt><font face="Arial">, run by Alice's 
  Internet Service Provider (ISP). </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The MTA looks at the destination address 
  provided in the SMTP protocol (not from the message header), in this case
  </font><tt><font face="Arial">bob@b.org</font></tt><font face="Arial">. An 
  Internet e-mail address is a string of the form </font><tt><font face="Arial">
  localpart@domain.example</font></tt><font face="Arial">, which is known as a 
  Fully Qualified Domain Address (FQDA). The part before the @ sign is the <b>
  local part</b> of the address, often the username of the recipient, and the 
  part after the @ sign is a domain name. The MTA looks up this domain name in 
  the Domain Name System to find the mail exchange servers accepting messages 
  for that domain. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The DNS server for the </font><tt>
  <font face="Arial">b.org</font></tt><font face="Arial"> domain, </font><tt>
  <font face="Arial">ns.b.org</font></tt><font face="Arial">, responds with an 
  MX record listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case
  </font><tt><font face="Arial">mx.b.org</font></tt><font face="Arial">, a 
  server run by Bob's ISP. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><tt><font face="Arial">smtp.a.org</font></tt><font face="Arial">

  <font face="Arial">bob</font></tt><font face="Arial">. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Bob presses the &quot;get mail&quot; button in his 
  MUA, which picks up the message using the Post Office Protocol (POP3). </font>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">This sequence of events applies to the 
majority of e-mail users. However, there are many alternative possibilities and 
complications to the e-mail system:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Alice or Bob may use a client connected 
  to a corporate e-mail system, such as IBM's Lotus Notes or Microsoft's 
  Exchange. These systems often have their own internal e-mail format and their 
  clients typically communicate with the e-mail server using a vendor-specific, 
  proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives e-mail via the Internet 
  through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary 
  reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire 
  transaction may happen completely within a single corporate e-mail system.
  </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Alice may not have a MUA on her computer 
  but instead may connect to a webmail service. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Alice's computer may run its own MTA, so 
  avoiding the transfer at step 1. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Bob may pick up his e-mail in many ways, 
  for example using the Internet Message Access Protocol, by logging into </font>
  <tt><font face="Arial">mx.b.org</font></tt><font face="Arial"> and reading it 
  directly, or by using a webmail service. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Domains usually have several mail 
  exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail when the main mail 
  exchange server is not available. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Emails are not secure if email 
  encryption is not used correctly. </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It used to be the case that many MTAs 
would accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to 
deliver them. Such MTAs are called <i>open mail relays</i>. This was important 
in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable. If 
an MTA couldn't reach the destination, it could at least deliver it to a relay 
that was closer to the destination. The relay would have a better chance of 
delivering the message at a later time. However, this mechanism proved to be 
exploitable by people sending unsolicited bulk e-mail and as a consequence very 
few modern MTAs are open mail relays, and many MTAs will not accept messages 
from open mail relays because such messages are very likely to be spam.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Prortocols used in E-mail</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Basicaly, a protocol is 
about a standard method used at each end of a communication channel, in order to 
properly transmit information. In order to deal with your email you must use a 
mail client to access a mail server. The mail client and mail server can 
exchange information with each other using a variety of protocols.</span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">IMAP Protocol:</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">IMAP 
(Internet Message Access Protocol)</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> – 
Is a standard protocol for accessing e-mail from your local server. IMAP is a 
client/server protocol in which e-mail is received and held for you by your 
Internet server. As this requires only a small data transfer this works well 
even over a slow connection such as a modem. Only if you request to read a 
specific email message will it be downloaded from the server. You can also 
create and manipulate folders or mailboxes on the server, delete messages etc.
</span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">POP3 Protocol:</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The <b>POP 
(Post Office Protocol 3)</b> protocol provides a simple, standardized way for 
users to access mailboxes and download messages to their computers.<br>
<br>
When using the POP protocol all your eMail messages will be downloaded from the 
mail server to your local computer. You can choose to leave copies of your 
eMails on the server as well. The advantage is that once your messages are 
downloaded you can cut the internet connection and read your eMail at your 
leisure without incuring further communication costs. On the other hand you 
might have transferred a lot of message (including spam or viruses) in which you 
are not at all interested at this point. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight:700">SMTP 
Protocol:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The <b>
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</b> protocol is used by the Mail Transfer 
Agent (MTA) to deliver your eMail to the recipient's mail server. The SMTP 
protocol can only be used to send emails, not to receive them. Depending on your 
network / ISP settings, you may only be able to use the SMTP protocol under 
certain conditions (see incoming and outgoing mail servers </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;HTTP 
Protocol:</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The <b>HTTP protocol</b> is 
not a protocol dedicated for email communications, but it can be used for 
accessing your mailbox. Also called web based email, this protocol can be used 
to compose or retrieve emails from an your account. Hotmail is a good example of 
using HTTP as an email protocol.</span></p>

<h1 align="justify"><font size="3">4 Major Components Present in all Effective Emails</font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A staple in any customer retention program 
is the ability to write emails that strengthen relationships, get responses, and 
persuade action. Not enough attention is often paid to this critical component 
of building a business (and when attention is given to it, I too frequently see 
it performed incorrectly.) As such I am going to cover a number of topics spread 
over a series of articles that will help you develop more effective email 
follow-up campaigns.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The first thing you have to do in building 
an effective email follow-up program is to determine your desired outcome of 
each email (you can’t build an effective email if you don’t know what you want 
to achieve from it.)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Depending on your desired outcome a 
response could be any number of things. Overall though, emails have three 
primary roles.</font></p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>Build Relationships:</strong> 
  All email programs should build a stronger relationship with your customer and 
  seek to enhance your brand in their eyes.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>Get Responses:</strong> Example- 
  respond to surveys, questions, feedback, etc…</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>Persuade Action:</strong> 
  Example- clicking a link in the email.</font></li>
</ol>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">No matter your intention, an email should 
aim for the following actions at a minimum and in the following order:</font></p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Get attention (interest)</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Get the open</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Get the action (response, click, etc…)</font></li>
</ol>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In other words, the job of an email is to
<strong>first</strong> get the attention of the recipient, <strong>second</strong> 
to persuade them to open the email, <strong>then</strong> finally get them to 
act upon something in the email by clicking (typically back to your site.)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It goes without saying you can’t get the 
open if you don’t get their attention and you can’t get the click if you don’t 
get them to open it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Now, having said that, how to you maximize 
the opportunity for achieving the three desired actions above (interest, open, 
action?)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">To do this you need to understand that 
there are 4 basic components which all emails are made up of.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Email</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">Email is a service which allows us to send the message in 
electronic mode over the internet. It offers an efficient, inexpensive and real 
time mean of distributing information among people.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">E-Mail Address</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">Each user of email is assigned a unique name for his email 
account. This name is known as E-mail address. Different users can send and 
receive messages according to the e-mail address.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">E-mail is generally of the form username@domainname. For 
example, webmaster@tutorialspoint.com is an e-mail address where webmaster is 
username and tutorialspoint.com is domain name.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul class="list">
    <li><font face="Arial">The username and the domain name are separated by <b>
    &amp; (at)</b> symbol. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">E-mail addresses are not case sensitive.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Spaces are not allowed in e-mail address.</font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3">E-mail Message Components</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">E-mail message comprises of different components: E-mail 
Header, Greeting, Text, and Signature. These components are described in the 
following diagram:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="file:///K:/cnnnn22/E-mail%20Overview_files/email_components.jpg" alt="internet_technologies_tutorial" width="560" height="450">
</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">E-mail Header</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The first five lines of an E-mail message is called E-mail 
header. The header part comprises of following fields:</font></p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><font face="Arial">From</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Date</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">To</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Subject</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">CC</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">BCC</font></li>
</ul>
<h4><font face="Arial">From</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">The <b>From</b> field indicates the sender’s address i.e. 
who sent the e-mail.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Date</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">The <b>Date</b> field indicates the date when the e-mail 
was sent.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">To</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">The <b>To</b> field indicates the recipient’s address i.e. 
to whom the e-mail is sent.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Subject</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">The <b>Subject</b> field indicates the purpose of e-mail. 
It should be precise and to the point.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">CC</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>CC</b> stands for Carbon copy. It includes those 
recipient addresses whom we want to keep informed but not exactly the intended 
recipient.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">BCC</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>BCC</b> stands for Black Carbon Copy. It is used when 
we do not want one or more of the recipients to know that someone else was 
copied on the message.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Greeting</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Greeting is the opening of the actual message. Eg. Hi Sir 
or Hi Guys etc.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Text</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">It represents the actual content of the message.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Signature</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">This is the final part of an e-mail message. It includes 
Name of Sender, Address, and Contact Number.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Advantages</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">E-mail has prooved to be powerful and reliable medium of 
commmunication. Here are the benefits of <b>E-mail:</b></font></p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><font face="Arial">Reliable</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Convenience</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Speed</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Inexpensive</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Printable</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Global</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Generality</font></li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Reliable</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">Many of the mail systems notify the sender if e-mail 
message was undeliverable.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Convenience</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">There is no requirement of stationary and stamps. One does 
not have to go to post office. But all these things are not required for sending 
or receiving an mail.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Speed</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">E-mail is very fast. However, the speed also depends upon 
the underlying network.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Inexpensive</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The cost of sending e-mail is very low.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Printable</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">It is easy to obtain a hardcopy of an e-mail. Also an 
electronic copy of an e-mail can also be saved for records.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Global</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">E-mail can be sent and received by a person sitting across 
the globe.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Generality</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">It is also possible to send graphics, programs and sounds 
with an e-mail.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Disadvantages</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">Apart from several benefits of E-mail, there also exists 
some disadvantages as discussed below:</font></p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><font face="Arial">Forgery</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Overload</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Misdirection</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Junk</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">No response</font></li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Forgery</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">E-mail doesn’t prevent from forgery, that is, someone 
impersonating the sender, since sender is usually not authenticated in any way.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Overload</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">Convenience of E-mail may result in a flood of mail.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Misdirection</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">It is possible that you may send e-mail to an unintended 
recipient.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Junk</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">Junk emails are undesirable and inappropriate emails. Junk 
emails are sometimes referred to as spam.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">No Response</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">It may be frustrating when the recipient does not read the 
e-mail and respond on a regular basis.</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>The 4 Components Present in 
Effective Emails</strong></font></p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">From Name</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Subject Line</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Email Content (body)</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Call to Action</font></li>
</ol>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><em>Of course every email should have an 
opt out option etc… but that is for another article and I will not go into 
detail on it here.</em></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">To achieve the first two actions (i.e. 
interest, open) you must develop an effective subject line. Make it short, 
sweet, and intriguing. Let’s say you are running a limited time fall promotion 
for some product you sell. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>The Subject Line</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A good subject line might be:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><em>Get 50% Off. 5 Days Only. Details 
Inside …</em></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A less powerful subject line might be:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><em>Fall Into Savings for a Limited Time!</em></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The first subject line clearly states the 
offer and then ends with a subtle call to action (details inside) followed by an 
ellipsis (or hellip)—An ellipsis is a three-dot symbol used to show an 
incomplete statement. Ellipses are used in on-screen menus to convey that there 
is more to come. (…)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>The From Line</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The from line should be the name of your 
business or website to be most effective. Why? It is your business or website 
that they are transacting with and using it in the “from” line will help trigger 
brand awareness which will answer at least one major question they will ask when 
they receive the email—”who sent me this email?”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The answer to that question combined with 
the subject line easily tells them what the offer is and who it is from. They 
need to know this so <strong>trust</strong> is built and any hesitation to open 
the email based on security is removed from the equation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ok, you have now accomplished the first 
objective and let’s say the open the email. What next?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Well you now need to make sure at least 
two basic things are present to get the next action (which is the click in our 
example.)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>The Content</strong><br>
Your email body (the text, images etc…) needs to reinforce the offer and provide 
details on it. Don’t go into your whole life story and write a book here. Keep 
it simple, state the benefits to the customer, stick to the facts, and then 
provide a call to action (or two).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Remember, people are overwhelmed by emails 
and they aren’t going to spend a ton of time reading so get to the point and 
make it compelling. Give them a reason to take action and then most importantly,
<strong>ask for the action</strong>! It does you no good to develop a super 
email, get it opened, and forget to give them ways to perform the final action.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Many people just need a good prompt to get 
it done and this is what is referred to as the “call to action”. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>The Call to Action</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Calls to action ask the reader to do 
something. They are things like “Shop Now!”, “Learn More”, “Click for Details”, 
“Go Shopping”, “Add to Cart”, etc… </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Provide your reader with a number of ways 
to get back to your site including hyperlinks to your domain, to the product(s) 
you are promoting, and a few good “calls to action” like listed here.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The call to action should also reflect 
what your intention is for them. If you want them to “Start Shopping” then tell 
them that. If you want them to “Complete the Survey” then tell them that. Don’t 
assume they will do it just because you present it to them—ask them to do it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Those are the basic components of what 
makeup all emails and how you can use them to develop an effective email that 
get the three desired actions completed—Get Interest, Get Opened, Get the 
Action.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<h1 align="justify">8 Components of an Effective Email </h1>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Every email your business sends has the 
potential to build relationships and boost sales. VerticalResponse is here to 
help ensure each email you send is effective. So, we’ve created a guide that 
breaks down eight components of an email. With this handy information, you’ll be 
on your way to creating successful email campaigns in no time.</font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>1. From label</strong></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">We start with the “from” label. Everyone 
pays attention to where an email comes from, it’s the first thing a person sees 
when they scan their inbox. Since this is such an important piece of inbox real 
estate, you want to make sure that the from label matches your company name, or 
whoever your recipient signed up to hear from when they subscribed to your list. 
This helps easily identify an email’s source.</font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;<strong>2. Subject line</strong></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When an email lands in your inbox, you 
decide whether or not you’re going to open it in a matter of seconds, right? One 
of the things you base your decision on is the subject line. Your subscribers do 
the same. This is why subject lines are so important. You could offer your 
customers the best deal or information in the world, but if you have a poorly 
written subject line, your customers won’t get far enough to take advantage of 
that great deal.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Beth Nagengast, who uses VerticalResponse 
to promote Cinquain Cellars, a winery in Paso Robles, California, says subject 
lines should be straightforward. “Tell your customer what’s in it for them,” she 
says. It’s good advice. Take a look at the subject line examples below.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The email from VerticalResponse tells 
customers the information they can expect to read about. The email from the 
electronics giant offers a deal. Both subject lines tell readers why they should 
open the email.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>Tips to creating subject lines:</strong></font></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Keep it short. Stick to 40-50 
  characters.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Don’t overuse punctuation (i.e. !!!) or 
  symbols.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Don’t use all caps.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Don’t repeat the from label.</font></li>
</ul>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>3. Pre-header</strong></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The pre-header is like a subject line’s 
sidekick. It’s the first line of text in your email. Some email programs, like 
Gmail or mobile phones, include the pre-header after the subject line so the 
reader can get a little more information before opening the email. See the grey 
text after the subject line? That’s the pre-header.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_s1026"
 type="#_x0000_t75" alt="8 Components of Effective Email Marketing" style='width:508.5pt;
 height:18.75pt'>
 <v:imagedata src="EMAIL_files/image003.png" o:href="file:///K:\cnnnn22\8%20Components%20of%20an%20Effective%20Email%20%5bGUIDE%5d_files\preheader.png"/>

v:shapes="_x0000_s1026"><![endif]></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It’s another way to grab attention. 
Whether it’s displayed next to the subject line or not, that first sentence in 
your email is vital. You want customers to keep reading. Try to write something 
that builds on the subject line and tells readers exactly what the email is 
about.</font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>4. Content</strong></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Now it’s time to get to the meat of your 
email marketing: content. The message that you create should provide value to 
your customer. Teach them about your business, offer a promotional deal, or keep 
them informed about new products or services. Whatever your goal is, make sure 
the content is succinct and informative.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">To set your emails apart from the rest, 
make a commitment to quality. Create content your customers want to read and 
then keep it coming. You want your customers to look forward to your emails. 
Importantly, every email should be error-free. You don’t want to sink your 
credibility with an email that’s riddled with misspellings and grammatical 
errors.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">You’ll also want to vary the kind of 
content you send. You can’t fill your customers’ inbox with dozens of 
promotional emails. If you try to sell too hard, you’ll push customers away. 
Offer an array of content. A company newsletter is the go-to email marketing for 
Cinquain Cellars. It helps the company build a relationship with customers. From 
product tips to a company newsletter, the name of the content game is diversity.</font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>5. Call to action</strong></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The point of every email is to get 
subscribers to take some kind of action. Whether you want them to make a 
purchase or take an online survey, a clear call to action makes it easy for the 
recipient to follow through.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When you’re creating an email, ask 
yourself, “What do I want the recipient to do?” If the answer is to make a 
purchase, you could include a “Shop Now” button in the email. If you want 
customers to take a survey, you would include a link that takes the recipient 
directly to the questionnaire.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The main thing to remember when creating 
the call to action is that it should be clear. We’re talking blatantly obvious. 
Take a look at this email.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>Tips to creating a strong call to 
action:</strong></font></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Keep it short: A call to action should 
  be no more than five words; most are only two words. You want something that’s 
  simple and effective. No need for flowery language here.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Use active language: You want customers 
  to act now, not two days from now. Use active words to get your customers 
  moving. Phrases like “Purchase now” or “Try our new service today” are good 
  examples.</font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Create a sense of urgency: Give 
  customers a reason to act now. For instance, put a limited time frame on deals 
  so customers won’t wait.</font></li>
</ul>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>6. Images</strong></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There’s an old saying that a picture is 
worth a thousand words, and it especially holds true in email marketing. Using 
an image in an email is a great way to appeal to your customer’s visual nature. 
One of the easiest ways to incorporate images is to highlight your product or 
service. Take a look at the example below.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_s1028"

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">This email wouldn’t be nearly as effective 
without the pictures of the product. The images give customers an idea of what 
the new product looks like. It’s invaluable information for customers and gives 
them a reason to shop.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you’re trying to market something that 
isn’t product-related, such as a service, you have to think outside the box. For 
instance, think about whom your product or service helps and try to use an image 
that relates. Take a look at the example below.</font></p>

<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial"><strong>7. Social media buttons</strong></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Don’t forget to include social media 
buttons in your email. You want your customers to engage with your brand as much 
as possible, so make it easy for them to check out your feeds. Take a look at 
the email below. Notice the Facebook, Twitter and YouTube options near the 
bottom.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">You may not be aware of it, but there are 
laws regarding email marketing. The CAN-SPAM Act says your email must include a 
way for customers to opt out. You can go about this in a couple of ways. You can 
put the word “Unsubscribe” at the bottom of the email that is linked to an 
unsubscribe option so customers can click on it and remove their names from your 
list. Or your readers can hit reply and include Unsubscribe in the subject line. 
At VerticalResponse, we manage all your opt outs.</font></p>

iceberg. We have tons of resources for you. From our digital marketing blog, to
