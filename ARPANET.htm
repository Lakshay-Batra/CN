<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The backbone of the ARPANET consisted of packet-switching computers, called 
IMPs (Interface Message Processors), connected by, for the time, superfast 56 
Kbit/s lines. Conventional computers with appropriate communications software 
were then connected to these IMP nodes. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The ARPANET was designed in the 1960s for the US Defense Department, so as to 
develop new bombproof, distributed packet-switching network technology. It got 
its name from the provider of the funds, the Advanced Research Projects Agency 
(ARPA). </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the autumn of 1969 the first ARPANET computer was connected to the 
ARPANET's IMP node at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Doug 
Engelbart's hypertext-project computer at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) was 
the next. By the end of the year, the network also included the computers at the 
University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and the University of Utah, i.e. 
four in all. All the computers used different operating systems and they were 
able to talk to each other across the network with equal status. Some years 
later, RFC1000 tells the story of these days of the birth of the Internet, in 
which enthusiastic students played an important part. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">During the 1970s, the ARPANET grew to connect research institutes and 
laboratories supported by the Department of Defense in various parts of the USA. 
Many of these were university laboratories studying data processing and computer 
networks, which developed the TCP/IP network and its applications for the 
Internet. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Public demonstration of the ARPANET by Bob Kahn of BBN. The demonstration 
consisted of a &quot;packet switch&quot;, and a TIP (Terminal Interface Processor) in the 
basement of the Washington Hilton Hotel. The public could use the TIP to run 
distributed applications across the US. According to Vinton Cerf, the 
demonstration was a &quot;roaring success&quot;.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In 1980 IP became the official standard of the US Department of Defense, and 
the original ARPANET adopted IP on 1.1.1983, when it became a major part of the 
Internet. At this time, Defense Department computers were separated from the 
ARPANET to form their own MILNET network. In 1986 the NSFNET constructs its own 
backbone network to run in parallel to the ARPANET. And, finally in 1990, with 
everyone having gone over to using the newer, faster Internet backbone network, 
the original ARPANET with its network address 10.0.0.0 was shut down. </font> </p>
