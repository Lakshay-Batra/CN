<font size="6">Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</font></span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Intrusion detection (ID) 
is a type of security management system for computers and networks. An ID system 
gathers and analyzes information from various areas within a computer or a 
network to identify possible security breaches, which include both intrusions 
(attacks from outside the organization) and misuse (attacks from within the 
organization). ID uses <i>vulnerability assessment</i> (sometimes referred to as
<i>scanning</i>), which is a technology developed to assess the security of a 
computer system or network. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Intrusion detection functions include:

</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">ID systems are being developed in response 
to the increasing number of attacks on major sites and networks, including those 
of the Pentagon, the White House, NATO, and the U.S. Defense Department. The 
safeguarding of security is becoming increasingly difficult, because the 
possible technologies of attack are becoming ever more sophisticated; at the 
same time, less technical ability is required for the novice attacker, because 
proven past methods are easily accessed through the Web. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Typically, an ID system follows a two-step 
process. The first procedures are host-based and are considered the <i>passive</i> 
component, these include: inspection of the system's configuration files to 
detect inadvisable settings; inspection of the password files to detect 
inadvisable passwords; and inspection of other system areas to detect policy 
violations. The second procedures are network-based and are considered the <i>
active</i> component: mechanisms are set in place to reenact known methods of 
attack and to record system responses. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">In 1998, 
ICSA.net, a leading security assurance organization, formed the Intrusion 
Detection Systems Consortium (IDSC) as an open forum for ID product developers 
with the aim of disseminating information to the end user and developing 
industry standards. </span></p>

An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic and monitors for 
suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. In some 
cases the IDS may also respond to anomalous or malicious traffic by taking 
action such as blocking the user or source IP address from accessing the 
network. </span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">IDS come in a variety of 
“flavors” and approach the goal of detecting suspicious traffic in different 
ways. There are network based (NIDS) and host based (HIDS) intrusion detection 
systems. There are IDS that detect based on looking for specific signatures of 
known threats- similar to the way antivirus software typically detects and 
protects against malware- and there are IDS that detect based on comparing 
traffic patterns against a baseline and looking for anomalies. There are IDS 
that simply monitor and alert and there are IDS that perform an action or 
actions in response to a detected threat. We’ll cover each of these briefly.
</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">NIDS</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Network Intrusion Detection 
Systems are placed at a strategic point or points within the network to monitor 
traffic to and from all devices on the network. Ideally you would scan all 
inbound and outbound traffic, however doing so might create a bottleneck that 
would impair the overall speed of the network. </span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">HIDS</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Host Intrusion Detection Systems 
are run on individual hosts or devices on the network. A HIDS monitors the 
inbound and outbound packets from the device only and will alert the user or 
administrator of suspicious activity is detected </span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Signature Based</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">A signature based IDS will 
monitor packets on the network and compare them against a database of signatures 
or attributes from known malicious threats. This is similar to the way most 
antivirus software detects malware. The issue is that there will be a lag 
between a new threat being discovered in the wild and the signature for 
detecting that threat being applied to your IDS. During that lag time your IDS 
would be unable to detect the new threat. </span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Anomaly Based</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">An IDS which is anomaly based 
will monitor network traffic and compare it against an established baseline. The 
baseline will identify what is “normal” for that network- what sort of bandwidth 
is generally used, what protocols are used, what ports and devices generally 
connect to each other- and alert the administrator or user when traffic is 
detected which is anomalous, or significantly different, than the baseline.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Passive 
IDS</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black"> </span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">A passive IDS simply detects and 
alerts. When suspicious or malicious traffic is detected an alert is generated 
and sent to the administrator or user and it is up to them to take action to 
block the activity or respond in some way. </span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Reactive IDS</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">A reactive IDS will not only 
detect suspicious or malicious traffic and alert the administrator, but will 
take pre-defined proactive actions to respond to the threat. Typically this 
means blocking any further network traffic from the source IP address or user.
</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">There is a fine line between a 
firewall and an IDS. There is also technology called IPS – Intrusion Prevention 
System. An IPS is essentially a firewall which combines network-level and 
application-level filtering with a reactive IDS to proactively protect the 
network. It seems that as time goes on firewalls, IDS and IPS take on more 
attributes from each other and blur the line even more. </span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Essentially, your firewall is 
your first line of perimeter defense. Best practices recommend that your 
firewall be explicitly configured to DENY all incoming traffic and then you open 
up holes where necessary. You may need to open up port 80 to host web sites or 
port 21 to host an FTP file server. Each of these holes may be necessary from 
one standpoint, but they also represent possible vectors for malicious traffic 
to enter your network rather than being blocked by the firewall. </span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: top" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">That is where your IDS would come 
in. Whether you implement a NIDS across the entire network or a HIDS on your 
specific device, the IDS will monitor the inbound and outbound traffic and 
identify suspicious or malicious traffic which may have somehow bypassed your 
firewall or it could possibly be originating from inside your network as well.
</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">An IDS can be 
a great tool for proactively monitoring and protecting your network from 
malicious activity, however they are also prone to false alarms. With just about 
any IDS solution you implement you will need to “tune it” once it is first 
installed.</span></p>
