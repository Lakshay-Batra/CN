<p><font face="Arial">Network operating systems (NOS) typically are used to run 
computers that act as servers. They provide the capabilities required for 
network operation. Network operating systems are also designed for client 
computers and provide functions so the distinction between network operating 
systems and stand alone operating systems is not always obvious. Network 
operating systems provide the following functions: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A universal naming convention (UNC) is used to allow the 
use of shared resources without mapping a drive to them. The UNC specifies a 
path name and has the form: </font></p>
<p class="indent"><font face="Arial">\\servername\pathname </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If I have a Linux server called &quot;linux3&quot; with a folder

<p><font face="Arial">A network operating system (NOS) is a computer operating 
system system that is designed primarily to support workstation, personal 
computer, and, in some instances, older terminal that are connected on a local 
area network (LAN). Artisoft's LANtastic, Banyan VINES, Novell's NetWare, and 
Microsoft's LAN Manager are examples of network operating systems. In addition, 
some multi-purpose operating systems, such as Windows NT and Digital's OpenVMS 
come with capabilities that enable them to be described as a network operating 
system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A network operating system provides printer sharing, 
common file system and database sharing, application sharing, and the ability to 
manage a network name directory, security, and other housekeeping aspects of a

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Windows 2.0 desktop</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The first independent version of Microsoft 
Windows, version 1.0, released on November 20, 1985, lacked a degree of 
functionality and achieved little popularity. It was originally going to be 
called <b>Interface Manager</b>, but Rowland Hanson, the head of marketing at 
Microsoft, convinced the company that the name <b>Windows</b> would be a more 
appealing name to consumers. Windows 1.0 did not provide a complete operating 
system, but rather extended MS-DOS and shared the latter's inherent flaws and 
problems. Moreover, the programs that shipped with the early version comprised 
&quot;toy&quot; applications with little or limited appeal to business users.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Furthermore, legal challenges by Apple 
limited its functionality. For example, windows could only appear &quot;tiled&quot; on the 
screen; that is, they could not overlap or overlie one another. Also, there was 
no trash can (place to store files prior to deletion), since Apple believed they 
owned the rights to that paradigm. Microsoft later removed both of these 
limitations by signing a licensing agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Microsoft Windows version 2 came out on 
December 9, 1987, and proved slightly more popular than its predecessor. Much of 
the popularity for Windows 2.0 came by way of its inclusion as a &quot;run-time 
version&quot; with Microsoft's new graphical applications, Excel and Word for 
Windows. They could be run from MS-DOS, executing Windows for the duration of 
their activity, and closing down Windows upon exit.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Microsoft Windows received a major boost 
around this time when Aldus PageMaker appeared in a Windows version, having 
previously run only on Macintosh. Some computer historians date this, the first 
appearance of a significant <i>and</i> non-Microsoft application for Windows, as 
the beginning of the success of Windows.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Versions 2.0x still used the real-mode 
memory model, which confined it to a maximum of 1 megabyte of memory. In such a 
configuration, it could run under another multitasker like DESQview, which used 
the 286 Protected Mode.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Later, two new versions were released: 
Windows/286 2.1 and Windows/386 2.1. Like previous versions of Windows, 
Windows/286 2.1 continued to use the real-mode memory model, but was the first 
version to support the HMA. Windows/386 2.1 had a protected mode kernel with 
LIM-standard EMS emulation, the predecessor to XMS which would finally change 
the topology of IBM PC computing. All Windows and DOS-based applications at the 
time were real mode, running over the protected mode kernel by using the virtual 
8086 mode, which was new with the 80386 processor.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Version 2.03, and later 3.0, faced 
challenges from Apple over its overlapping windows and other features Apple 
charged mimicked the &quot;look and feel&quot; of its operating system and &quot;embodie[d] and 
generate[d] a copy of the Macintosh&quot; in its OS. Judge William Schwarzer dropped 
all but 10 of the 189 charges that Apple had sued Microsoft with on January 5, 
1989.</font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
Success with Windows 3.0</span></font></h2>
<h2 align="center"><img border="0" src="WIN3.png" width="300" height="225"></h2>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-weight: 400"><font face="Arial" size="3">Microsoft Windows scored a significant 
success with Windows 3.0, released in 1990. In addition to improved capabilities 
given to native applications, Windows also allowed a user to better multitask 
older MS-DOS based software compared to Windows/386, thanks to the introduction 
of virtual memory. It made PC compatibles serious competitors to the Apple 
Macintosh. This benefited from the improved graphics available on PCs by this 
time (by means of VGA video cards), and the Protected/Enhanced mode which 
allowed Windows applications to use more memory in a more painless manner than 
their DOS counterparts could. Windows 3.0 could run in any of Real, Standard, or 
386 Enhanced modes, and was compatible with any Intel processor from the 
8086/8088 up to 80286 and 80386. Windows tried to auto detect which mode to run 
in, although it could be forced to run in a specific mode using the switches: /r 
(real), /s (standard) and /3 (386 enhanced) respectively. This was the first 
version to run Windows programs in protected mode, although the 386 enhanced 
mode kernel was an enhanced version of the protected mode kernel in Windows/386.</font></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Due to this backward compatibility, 
applications also had to be compiled in a 16-bit environment, without ever using 
the full 32-bit capabilities of the 386 CPU.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A limited multimedia version, Windows 3.0 
with Multimedia Extensions 1.0, was released several months later. This was 
bundled with the first sound card / CD-ROM multimedia kits e.g. Creative Labs 
Sound Blaster Pro along with titles such as MS Bookshelf. This version was the 
precursor to the multimedia features available in v3.1 later.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">However, features listed above, as well as 
the growing market support made Windows 3.0 wildly successful—selling around 10 
million copies in the two years before the release of version 3.1, Windows 3.0 
became a major source of income for Microsoft, and led the company to revise 
some of its earlier plans.</font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">A step 
sideways: OS/2</span></font></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">During the mid to late 1980s, Microsoft 
and IBM had co-operatively been developing OS/2 as a successor to DOS. OS/2 
would take full advantage of the aforementioned Protected Mode of the Intel 
80286 processor and up to 16M of memory. OS/2 1.0, released in 1987, supported 
swapping and multitasking and allowed running of DOS executables.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A GUI, called the Presentation Manager 
(PM), was not available with OS/2 until version 1.1, released in 1988. Although 
some considered it to be in many ways superior to Windows, its API was 
incompatible with Windows. (Among other things, Presentation Manager placed X,Y 
coordinate 0,0 at the <i>bottom</i> left of the screen like Cartesian 
coordinates, while Windows put 0,0 at the <i>top</i> left of the screen like 
most other computer window systems.) Version 1.2, released in 1989, introduced a 
new file system, HPFS, to replace the DOS FAT file system used by Windows.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">By the early 1990s, conflicts developed in 
the Microsoft/IBM relationship. They co-operated with each other in developing 
their PC operating systems, and had access to each other's code. Microsoft 
wanted to further develop Windows, while IBM desired for future work to be based 
on OS/2. In an attempt to resolve this tension, IBM and Microsoft agreed that 
IBM would develop OS/2 2.0, to replace OS/2 1.3 and Windows 3.0, while Microsoft 
would develop a new operating system, OS/2 3.0, to later succeed OS/2 2.0.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">This agreement soon however fell apart, 
and the Microsoft/IBM relationship was terminated. IBM continued to develop 
OS/2, while Microsoft changed the name of its (as yet unreleased) OS/2 3.0 to 
Windows NT. Both retained the rights to use OS/2 and Windows technology 
developed up to the termination of the agreement; Windows NT, however, was to be 
written anew, mostly independently (see below).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">After an interim 1.3 version to fix up 
many remaining problems with the 1.x series, IBM released OS/2 version 2.0 in 
1992. This was a major improvement: it featured a new, object-oriented GUI, the 
Workplace Shell (WPS), that included a desktop and was considered by many to be 
OS/2's best feature. Microsoft would later imitate much of it in Windows 95. 
Version 2.0 also provided a full 32-bit API, offered smooth multitasking and 
could take advantage of the 4 gigabytes of address space provided by the Intel 
80386. Still, much of the system still had 16-bit code internally which 
required, among other things, device drivers to be 16-bit code as well. This was 
one of the reasons for the chronic shortage of OS/2 drivers for the latest 
devices. Version 2.0 could also run DOS and Windows 3.0 programs, since IBM had 
retained the right to use the DOS and Windows code as a result of the breakup.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">At the time, it was unclear who would win 
the so-called &quot;Desktop wars&quot;. But in the end, OS/2 did not manage to gain enough 
market share, even though IBM released several improved versions subsequently 
(see below).</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
Windows 3.1 and NT</span></font></h2>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">Windows 3.11 desktop</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In response to the impending release of 
OS/2 2.0, Microsoft developed Windows 3.1, which included several minor 
improvements to Windows 3.0 (such as display of TrueType scalable fonts, 
developed jointly with Apple), but primarily consisted of bugfixes and 
multimedia support. It also removed support for Real mode, and would only run on 
an 80286 or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a 
touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that 
followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992. Around the same time, Microsoft 
released Windows for Workgroups (WfW), available both as an add-on for existing 
Windows 3.1 installations and in a version that included the base Windows 
environment and the networking extensions all in one package. Windows for 
Workgroups included improved network drivers and protocol stacks, and support 
for peer-to-peer networking. One optional download for WfW was the &quot;Wolverine&quot; 
TCP/IP protocol stack, which allowed for easy access to the Internet through 
corporate networks. There were two versions of Windows for Workgroups, WfW 3.1 
and WfW 3.11. Unlike the previous versions, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 only 
runs in 386 Enhanced mode, and requires at least an 80386SX processor.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">All these versions continued version 3.0's 
impressive sales pace. Even though the 3.1x series still lacked most of the 
important features of OS/2, such as long file names, a desktop, or protection of 
the system against misbehaving applications, Microsoft quickly took over the OS 
and GUI markets for the IBM PC. The Windows API became the de-facto standard for 
consumer software.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Meanwhile Microsoft continued to develop 
Windows NT. The main architect of the system was Dave Cutler, one of the chief 
architects of VMS at Digital Equipment Corporation (later purchased by Compaq, 
now part of Hewlett-Packard). Microsoft hired him in 1988 to create a portable 
version of OS/2, but Cutler created a completely new system instead. Cutler had 
been developing a follow-on to VMS at DEC called Mica, and when DEC dropped the 
project he brought the expertise and some engineers with him to Microsoft. DEC 
also believed he brought Mica's code to Microsoft and sued. Microsoft eventually 
paid $150 million U.S. and agreed to support DEC's Alpha CPU chip in NT.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Windows NT 3.1 (Microsoft marketing 
desired to make Windows NT appear to be a continuation of Windows 3.1) arrived 
in Beta form to developers at the July 1992 Professional Developers Conference 
in San Francisco. Microsoft announced at the conference its intentions to 
develop a successor to both Windows NT and Windows 3.1's replacement (code-named 
Chicago), which would unify the two into one operating system. This successor 
was codenamed Cairo. In hindsight, Cairo was a much more difficult project than 
Microsoft had anticipated, and as a result, NT and Chicago would not be unified 
until Windows XP, and still, parts of Cairo have not made it into Windows as of 
today. Specifically, the WinFS subsystem, which was the much touted Object File 
System of Cairo, which had been put on hold for a while, but Microsoft further 
announced that they've discontinued WinFS and they'll gradually incorporate the 
technologies developed for WinFS in other products and technologies, notably, 
Microsoft SQL Server.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Driver support was lacking due to the 
increased programming difficulty in dealing with NT's superior hardware 
abstraction model. This problem plagued the NT line all the way through Windows 
2000. Programmers complained that it was too hard to write drivers for NT, and 
hardware developers were not going to go through the trouble of developing 
drivers for a small segment of the market. Additionally, although allowing for 
good performance and fuller exploitation of system resources, it was also 
resource-intensive on limited hardware, and thus was only suitable for larger, 
more expensive machines. Windows NT would not work for private users because of 
its resource demands; moreover, its GUI was simply a copy of Windows 3.1's, 
which was inferior to the OS/2 Workplace Shell, so there was not a good reason 
to propose it as a replacement to Windows 3.1.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">However, the same features made Windows NT 
perfect for the LAN server market (which in 1993 was experiencing a rapid boom, 
as office networking was becoming a commodity), as it enjoyed advanced network 
connectivity options, and the efficient NTFS file system. Windows NT version 
3.51 was Microsoft's stake into this market, a large part of which would be won 
over from Novell in the following years.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">One of Microsoft's biggest advances 
initially developed for Windows NT was new 32-bit API, to replace the legacy 
16-bit Windows API. This API was called Win32, and from then on Microsoft 
referred to the older 16-bit API as Win16. Win32 API had three main 
implementations: one for Windows NT, one for Win32s (which was a subset of Win32 
which could be used on Windows 3.1 systems), and one for Chicago. Thus Microsoft 
sought to ensure some degree of compatibility between the Chicago design and 
Windows NT, even though the two systems had radically different internal 
architectures. Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a 
hybrid kernel.</font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
Windows 95</span></font></h2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="WIN6.png" width="300" height="225"></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">Microsoft Windows 95 desktop</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">After Windows 3.11, Microsoft began to 
develop a new consumer oriented version of the operating system code-named 
Chicago. Chicago was designed to have support for 32-bit pre-emptive 
multitasking like OS/2 and Windows NT, although a 16-bit kernel would remain for 
the sake of backward compatibility. The Win32 API first introduced with Windows 
NT was adopted as the standard 32-bit programming interface, with Win16 
compatibility being preserved through a technique known as &quot;thunking&quot;. A new GUI 
was not originally planned as part of the release, although elements of the 
Cairo user interface were borrowed and added as other aspects of the release 
(notably Plug and Play) slipped.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Microsoft did not change all of the 
Windows code to 32-bit; parts of it remained 16-bit (albeit not directly using 
real mode) for reasons of compatibility, performance and development time. This, 
and the fact that the numerous design flaws had to be carried over from the 
earlier Windows versions, eventually began to impact on the operating system's 
efficiency and stability.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Microsoft marketing adopted Windows 95 as 
the product name for Chicago when it was released on August 24, 1995. Microsoft 
had a double gain from its release: first it made it impossible for consumers to 
use a cheaper, non-Microsoft DOS; secondly, although traces of DOS were never 
completely removed from the system, and a version of DOS would be loaded briefly 
as a part of the bootstrap process, Windows 95 applications ran solely in 386 
Enhanced Mode, with a flat 32-bit address space and virtual memory. These 
features made it possible for Win32 applications to address up to 2 gigabytes of 
virtual RAM (with another 2GB reserved for the operating system), and in theory 
prevented them from inadvertently corrupting the memory space of other Win32 
applications. In this respect the functionality of Windows 95 moved closer to 
Windows NT, although Windows 95/98/ME did not support more than 512 megabytes of 
physical RAM without obscure system tweaks.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">IBM continued to market OS/2, producing 
later versions in OS/2 3.0 and 4.0 (also called Warp). Responding to complaints 
about OS/2 2.0's high demands on computer hardware, version 3.0 was 
significantly optimized both for speed and size. Before Windows 95 was released, 
OS/2 Warp 3.0 was even shipped preinstalled with several large German hardware 
vendor chains. However, with the release of Windows 95, OS/2 began to lose 
marketshare.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It is probably impossible to nail down a 
specific reason why OS/2 failed to gain much marketshare. While OS/2 continued 
to run Windows 3.1 applications, it lacked support for anything but the Win32s 
subset of Win32 API (see above). Unlike Windows 3.1, IBM did not have access to 
the source code for Windows 95 and was unwilling to commit the time and 
resources to emulate the moving target of the Win32 API. IBM also introduced 
OS/2 into the United States v. Microsoft case, blaming unfair marketing tactics 
on Microsoft's part, but many people would probably agree that IBM's own 
marketing problems and lack of support for developers contributed at least as 
much to the failure.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Microsoft released five different versions

generally found to be more stable and reliable than its 1995 predecessor. It 
included new hardware drivers and better support for the FAT32 file system which 
allowed support for disk partitions larger than the 2 GB maximum accepted by 
Windows 95. The USB support in Windows 98 was far superior to the token, sketchy 
support provided by the OEM editions of Windows 95. It also controversially 
integrated the Internet Explorer browser into the Windows GUI and Windows

Microsoft released Windows 2000, known 
during its development cycle as &quot;NT 5.0&quot;, in February 2000. It was successfully 
deployed both on the server and the workstation markets. Amongst Windows 2000s 
most significant new features was Active Directory, a near-complete replacement 
of the NT 4.0 Windows Server domain model, which built on industry-standard 
technologies like DNS, LDAP, and Kerberos to connect machines to one another. 
Terminal Services, previously only available as a separate edition of NT 4, was 
expanded to all server versions. A number of features from Windows 98 were 
incorporated as well, such as an improved Device Manager, Windows Media Player, 
and a revised DirectX that made it possible for the first time for many modern 
games to work on the NT kernel.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">While Windows 2000 could upgrade a 
computer running Windows 98, Windows 2000 was not widely regarded as a product 
suitable for home users. The reasons for this were many, chief amongst them the 
lack of device drivers for many common consumer devices such as scanners and 
printers (at the time of release; situation reversed when Windows XP was 
released).</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In September 2000, Microsoft introduced 
Windows Me (Millennium Edition), which upgraded Windows 98 with enhanced 
multimedia and Internet features. It also introduced the first version of <i>
System Restore</i>, which allowed users to revert their system state to a 
previous &quot;known-good&quot; point in the case of system failure. System Restore was a 
notable feature that made its way into Windows XP. The first version of Windows 
Movie Maker was introduced as well.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Windows Me was conceived as a quick 
one-year project that served as a stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows 
XP. Many of the new features were available from the Windows Update site as 
updates (<i>System Restore</i> was an exception). As a result, Windows Me was 
not acknowledged as a unique OS along the lines of 95 or 98. Windows Me was 
widely criticised for serious stability issues, and for lacking real mode DOS 
support, to the point of being referred to as the &quot;Mistake Edition&quot;. Windows Me 
was the last operating system to be based on the Windows 9x (monolithic) kernel 
and MS-DOS. It is also the last Windows operating system to lack Product 
Activation.</font></p>

The merging of the Windows NT/2000 and Windows 3.1/95/98/ME lines was achieved 
with Windows XP (codenamed &quot;Whistler&quot;). Windows XP uses the Windows NT 5.1 
kernel; however, it finally marks the entrance of the Windows NT core to the 
consumer market, to replace the aging 16-bit branch. Windows XP is the longest 
version of Windows ever released between upgrades, from 2001 all the way to 2007 
when Windows Vista was released to consumers. The Windows XP line of operating 
systems were surpassed by Windows Vista on January 30, 2007.</font></p>
