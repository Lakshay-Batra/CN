<font size="6">FIREWALL</font></span></b></u></span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In computing, a <b>firewall</b> is a piece 
of hardware and/or software which functions in a networked environment to 
prevent some communications forbidden by the security policy, analogous to the 
function of firewalls in building construction. A firewall is also called a <b>
Border Protection Device</b> (<b>BPD</b>), especially in NATO contexts, or <b>
packet filter</b> in BSD contexts. A firewall has the basic task of controlling 
traffic between different zones of trust. Typical zones of trust include the 
Internet (a zone with no trust) and an internal network (a zone with high 
trust). The ultimate goal is to provide controlled connectivity between zones of 
differing trust levels through the enforcement of a security policy and 
connectivity model based on the least privilege principle.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Proper configuration of firewalls demands 
skill from the administrator. It requires considerable understanding of network 
protocols and of computer security. Small mistakes can render a firewall 
worthless as a security tool.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Firewall technology first began to emerge in the late 1980s. Internet was still 
a fairly new technology in terms of its global usage and connectivity. The 
original idea was formed in response to a number of major internet security 
breaches, which occurred in the late 1980s. In 1988 an employee at the NASA Ames 
Research Center in California sent a memo by email to his colleagues that read, 
&quot;We are currently under attack from an Internet VIRUS! It has hit Berkeley, UC 
San Diego, Lawrence Livermore, Stanford, and NASA Ames.&quot; This virus known as the 
Morris Worm was carried by e-mail and is now a common nuisance for even the most 
ambiguous domestic user. The Morris Worm was the first large scale attack on 
Internet security, of which the online community neither expected, nor were 
prepared for. The internet community made it a top priority to combat any future 
attacks from happening and began to collaborate on new ideas, systems and 
software to make the internet safe again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">The 
first paper published on firewall technology was in 1988, when Jeff Mogul from 
Digital Equipment Corp. developed filter systems know as packet filter 
firewalls. This fairly basic system was the first generation of what would 
become a highly evolved and technical internet security feature. From 1980-1990 
two colleagues from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, Dave Presetto and Howard Trickey, 
developed the second generation of firewalls known as circuit level firewalls. 
Publications by Gene Spafford of Purdue University, Bill Cheswick at AT&amp;T 
laboratories and Marcus Ranum described a third generation firewall known as 
application layer firewall, also known as proxy-based firewalls. Marcus Ranum's 
work on the technology spearheaded the creation of the first commercial product. 
The product was released by Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) who named it 
the SEAL product. DEC’s first major sale was on June 13, 1991 to a chemical 
company based on the East-Coast of the USA.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">At 
AT&amp;T Bill Cheswick and Steve Bellovin were continuing their research in packet 
filtering and developed a working model for their own company based upon their 
original 1st generation architecture. In 1992, Bob Braden and Annette DeSchon at 
the University of Southern California were developing their own fourth 
generation packet filter firewall system. The product known as “Visas” was the 
first system to have a visual integration interface with colours and icons, 
which could be easily implemented to and accessed on a computer operating system 
such as Microsoft's Windows or Apple's Mac/OS. In 1994 an Israeli company called 
Check Point Software Technologies built this in to readily available software 
known as FireWall-1. A second generation of proxy firewalls was based on Kernel 
Proxy technology. This design is constantly evolving but its basic features and 
codes are currently in widespread use in both commercial and domestic computer 
systems. Cisco, one of the largest internet security companies in the world 
released the product to the public in 1997.</span></p>

<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Types of firewalls</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">There 
are three basic types of firewalls depending on:</span></p>
<ul type="disc" lastCheckbox="null" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Whether the communication is being 
  done between a single node and the network, or between two or more networks.
  </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Whether the communication is 
  intercepted at the network layer, or at the application layer. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Whether the communication state is 
  being tracked at the firewall or not. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">With 
regard to the scope of filtered communications there exist:</span></p>
<ul type="disc" lastCheckbox="null" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Personal firewalls, a software 
  application which normally filters traffic entering or leaving a single 
  computer. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Network firewalls, normally running 
  on a dedicated network device or computer positioned on the boundary of two or 
  more networks or DMZs (demilitarized zones). Such a firewall filters all 
  traffic entering or leaving the connected networks. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">The 
latter definition corresponds to the conventional, traditional meaning of 
&quot;firewall&quot; in networking.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">In 
reference to the layers where the traffic can be intercepted, three main 
categories of firewalls exist:</span></p>
<ul type="disc" lastCheckbox="null" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Network layer firewalls. An example 
  would be iptables. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Application layer firewalls. An 
  example would be TCP Wrappers. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Application firewalls. An example 
  would be restricting ftp services through /etc/ftpaccess file </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">These 
network-layer and application-layer types of firewall may overlap, even though 
the personal firewall does not serve a network; indeed, single systems have 
implemented both together.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
There's also the notion of application firewalls which are sometimes used during 
wide area network (WAN) networking on the world-wide web and govern the system 
software. An extended description would place them lower than application layer 
firewalls, indeed at the Operating System layer, and could alternately be called 
operating system firewalls. Some firewalls have higher privileges than others 
like mysql and pj.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Lastly, depending on whether the firewalls track packet states, two additional 
categories of firewalls exist:</span></p>
<ul type="disc" lastCheckbox="null" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Stateful firewalls </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Stateless firewalls </span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Network layer 
firewalls</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Network</span></b><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial"> layer firewalls 
operate at a (relatively) low level of the TCP/IP protocol stack as IP-packet 
filters, not allowing packets to pass through the firewall unless they match the 
rules. The firewall administrator may define the rules; or default built-in 
rules may apply (as in some inflexible firewall systems).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">A more 
permissive setup could allow any packet to pass the filter as long as it does 
not match one or more &quot;negative-rules&quot;, or &quot;deny rules&quot;. Today network firewalls 
are built into most computer operating systems and network appliances.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Modern 
firewalls can filter traffic based on many packet attributes like source IP 
address, source port, destination IP address or port, destination service like 
WWW or FTP. They can filter based on protocols, TTL values, netblock of 
originator, domain name of the source, and many other attributes.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Application-layer 
firewalls</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Application-layer firewalls work on the application level of the TCP/IP stack 
(i.e., all browser traffic, or all telnet or ftp traffic), and may intercept all 
packets traveling to or from an application. They block other packets (usually 
dropping them without acknowledgement to the sender). In principle, application 
firewalls can prevent all unwanted outside traffic from reaching protected 
machines.</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">By 
inspecting all packets for improper content, firewalls can even prevent the 
spread of the likes of viruses. In practice, however, this becomes so complex 
and so difficult to attempt (given the variety of applications and the diversity 
of content each may allow in its packet traffic) that comprehensive <i>firewall 
design does not generally attempt this approach.</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">The 
XML firewall exemplifies a more recent kind of application-layer firewall.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Proxies</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">A 
proxy device (running either on dedicated hardware or as software on a 
general-purpose machine) may act as a firewall by responding to input packets 
(connection requests, for example) in the manner of an application, whilst 
blocking other packets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Proxies make tampering with an internal system from the external network more 
difficult and misuse of one internal system would not necessarily cause a 
security breach exploitable from outside the firewall (as long as the 
application proxy remains intact and properly configured). Conversely, intruders 
may hijack a publicly-reachable system and use it as a proxy for their own 
purposes; the proxy then masquerades as that system to other internal machines. 
While use of internal address spaces enhances security, crackers may still 
employ methods such as <i>IP spoofing</i> to attempt to pass packets to a target 
network..</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Network address 
translation</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Firewalls often have network address translation (NAT) functionality, and the 
hosts protected behind a firewall commonly use so-called &quot;private address 
space&quot;, as defined in RFC 1918. Administrators often set up such scenarios in an 
effort (of debatable effectiveness) to disguise the internal address or network.</span></p>

Force is working on standardizing protocols for managing firewalls and other 
middleboxes.</span><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
