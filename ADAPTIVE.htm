ROUTING</font></b></u></p>
<p align="justify"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Adaptive routing</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
describes the capability of a system, through which routes are characterized by 
their destination, to alter the path that the route takes through the system in 
response to a change in conditions. The adaptation is intended to allow as many 
routes as possible to remain valid (that is, have destinations that can be 
reached) in response to the change.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">People using a transport 
system can display adaptive routing. For example, if a local railway station is 
closed, people can alight from a train at a different station and use another 
method, such as a bus, to reach their destination.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The term is commonly used in 
data networking to describe the capability of a network to 'route around' 
damage, such as loss of a node or a connection between nodes, so long as other 
path choices are available. There are several protocols used to achieve this:</span></p>

</ul>
<p align="justify"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Static routing</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
describes a system that does not implement adaptive routing. In these systems 
routes through a data network are described by fixed paths (statically). These 
routes are usually entered into the router by the system administrator. An 
entire network can be configured using static routes but this type of 
configuration is not fault tolerant. When there is a change in the network or a 
failure occurs between two statically defined nodes traffic will not be 
rerouted. This means that anything that wishes to take an affected path will 
either have to wait for the failure to be repaired or the static route to be 
updated by the administrator before restarting its journey. Most requests will 
time out (ultimately failing) before these repairs can be made.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Dynamic routing: </span>
</b><span style="font-family:Arial">The ability for a router to forward data via 
a different route based on the current conditions of the communications 
circuits. For example, it can adjust for overloaded traffic or failing lines and 
is much more flexible than static routing, which uses a fixed forwarding path.</span></p>
