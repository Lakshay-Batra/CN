DEVICES</b></font></u></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Hub</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;A hub is the central part of a wheel 
where the spokes come together. The term is familiar to frequent fliers who 
travel through airport &quot;hubs&quot; to make connecting flights from one point to 
another. In data communications, a hub is a place of convergence where data 
arrives from one or more directions and is forwarded out in one or more other 
directions. A hub usually includes a switch of some kind. (And a product that is 
called a &quot;switch&quot; could usually be considered a hub as well.) The distinction 
seems to be that the hub is the place where data comes together and the switch 
is what determines how and where data is forwarded from the place where data 
comes together. Regarded in its switching aspects, a hub can also include a 
router. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">1) In describing network topologies, a hub 
topology consists of a backbone (main circuit) to which a number of outgoing 
lines can be attached (&quot;dropped&quot;), each providing one or more connection port 
for device to attach to. For Internet users not connected to a local area 
network, this is the general topology used by your access provider. Other common 
network topologies are the bus network and the ring network. (Either of these 
could possibly feed into a hub network, using a bridge.) </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">2) As a network product, a hub may include 
a group of modem cards for dial-in users, a gateway card for connections to a 
local area network (for example, an Ethernet or a Token Ring), and a connection 
to a </font>
<term></term>
<font face="Arial">line (the main line in this example). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Bridge</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In telecommunication networks, a bridge is 
a product that connects a local area network (LAN) to another local area network 
that uses the same protocol (for example, Ethernet or Token Ring). You can 
envision a bridge as being a device that decides whether a message from you to 
someone else is going to the local area network in your building or to someone 
on the local area network in the building across the street. A bridge examines 
each message on a LAN, &quot;passing&quot; those known to be within the same LAN, and 
forwarding those known to be on the other interconnected LAN (or LANs). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In bridging networks, computer or node 
addresses have no specific relationship to location. For this reason, messages 
are sent out to every address on the network and accepted only by the intended 
destination node. Bridges learn which addresses are on which network and develop 
a <i>learning table</i> so that subsequent messages can be forwarded to the 
right network. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Bridging networks are generally always 
interconnected local area networks since broadcasting every message to all 
possible destinations would flood a larger network with unnecessary traffic. For 
this reason, router networks such as the Internet use a scheme that assigns 
addresses to nodes so that a message or packet can be forwarded only in one 
general direction rather than forwarded in all directions. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A bridge works at the data-link (physical 
network) level of a network, copying a data frame from one network to the next 
network along the communications path. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A bridge is sometimes combined with a 
router in a product called a brouter.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Switch</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In a telecommunications network, a switch 
is a device that channels incoming data from any of multiple input ports to the 
specific output port that will take the data toward its intended destination. In 
the traditional circuit-switched telephone network, one or more switches are 
used to set up a dedicated though temporary connection or circuit for an 
exchange between two or more parties. On an Ethernet local area network (LAN), a 
switch determines from the physical device (<term>Media Access Control</term> or 
MAC) address in each incoming message frame which output port to forward it to 
and out of. In a wide area packet-switched network such as the Internet, a 
switch determines from the IP address in each packet which output port to use 
for the next part of its trip to the intended destination. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 
communications model, a switch performs the layer 2 or Data-Link layer function. 
That is, it simply looks at each packet or data unit and determines from a 
physical address (the &quot;MAC address&quot;) which device a data unit is intended for 
and switches it out toward that device. However, in wide area networks such as 
the Internet, the destination address requires a look-up in a routing table by a 
device known as a router. Some newer switches also perform routing functions 
(layer 3 or the Network layer functions in OSI) and are sometimes called
<term>IP switch</term>es. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">On larger networks, the trip from one 
switch point to another in the network is called a hop. The time a switch takes 
to figure out where to forward a data unit is called its latency. The price paid 
for having the flexibility that switches provide in a network is this latency. 
Switches are found at the backbone and gateway levels of a network where one 
network connects with another and at the sub network level where data is being 
forwarded close to its destination or origin. The former are often known as <i>
core switches</i> and the latter as <i>desktop switches</i>. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the simplest networks, a switch is not 
required for messages that are sent and received within the network. For 
example, a local area network may be organized in a Token Ring or bus 
arrangement in which each possible destination inspects each message and reads 
any message with its address. </font></p>
<h4 align="justify"><font face="Arial">Circuit-Switching version 
Packet-Switching</font></h4>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A network's paths can be used exclusively 
for a certain duration by two or more parties and then switched for use to 
another set of parties. This type of &quot;switching&quot; is known as <i>
circuit-switching</i> and is really a dedicated and continuously connected path 
for its duration. Today, an ordinary voice phone calls generally uses 
circuit-switching. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Most data today is sent, using digital 
signals, over networks that use <i>packet-switching</i>. Using packet-switching, 
all network users can share the same paths at the same time and the particular 
route a data unit travels can be varied as conditions change. In 
packet-switching, a message is divided into packets, which are units of a 
certain number of bytes. The network addresses of the sender and of the 
destination are added to the packet. Each network point looks at the packet to 
see where to send it next. Packets in the same message may travel different 
routes and may not arrive in the same order that they were sent. At the 
destination, the packets in a message are collected and reassembled into the 
original message. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Router</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">n packet-switched networks such as the 
Internet, a router is a device or, in some cases, software in a computer, that 
determines the next network point to which a packet should be forwarded toward 
its destination. The router is connected to at least two networks and decides 
which way to send each information packet based on its current understanding of 
the state of the networks it is connected to. A router is located at any gateway 
(where one network meets another), including each point-of-presence on the 
Internet. A router is often included as part of a network switch. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A router may create or maintain a table of 
the available routes and their conditions and use this information along with 
distance and cost algorithms to determine the best route for a given packet. 
Typically, a packet may travel through a number of network points with routers 
before arriving at its destination. Routing is a function associated with the 
Network layer (layer 3) in the standard model of network programming, the Open 
Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. A
<term>layer-3 switch</term> is a switch that can perform routing functions.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">An edge router is a router that interfaces 
with an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. A brouter is a network bridge 
combined with a router. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">For home and business computer users who 
have high-speed Internet connections such as cable, satellite, or DSL, a router 
can act as a hardware firewall. This is true even if the home or business has 
only one computer. Many engineers believe that the use of a router provides 
better protection against hacking than a software firewall, because no computer
<term>Internet Protocol address</term> are directly exposed to the Internet. 
This makes port scans (a technique for exploring weaknesses) essentially 
impossible. In addition, a router does not consume computer resources as a 
software firewall does. Commercially manufactured routers are easy to install, 
reasonably priced, and available for hard-wired or wireless networks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Gateway</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A gateway is a network point that acts as 
an entrance to another network. On the Internet, a node or stopping point can be 
either a gateway node or a host (end-point) node. Both the computers of Internet 
users and the computers that serve pages to users are host nodes. The computers 
that control traffic within your company's network or at your local Internet 
service provider (ISP) are gateway nodes. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the network for an enterprise, a 
computer server acting as a gateway node is often also acting as a proxy server 
and a firewall server. A gateway is often associated with both a router, which 
knows where to direct a given packet of data that arrives at the gateway, and a 
switch, which furnishes the actual path in and out of the gateway for a given 
packet. </font></p>

<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">A
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 700; FONT-STYLE: italic">repeater</span> is a 
physical layer device used to interconnect the media segments of an extended 
network. A repeater essentially enables a series of cable segments to be treated 
as a single cable. Repeaters receive signals from one network segment and 
amplify, retime, and retransmit those signals to another network segment. These 
actions prevent signal deterioration caused by long cable lengths and large 
numbers of connected devices. Repeaters are incapable of performing complex 
filtering and other traffic processing. In addition, all electrical signals, 
including electrical disturbances and other errors, are repeated and amplified. 
The total number of repeaters and network segments that can be connected is 
limited due to timing and other issues. Figure 2-6 illustrates a repeater 
connecting two network segments. </font></p>
