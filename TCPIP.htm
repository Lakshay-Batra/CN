<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The TCP/IP model uses four layers that 
logically span the equivalent of the top six layers of the OSI reference model. 
The physical layer is not covered by the TCP/IP model because the data link 
layer is considered the point at which the interface occurs between the TCP/IP 
stack and the underlying networking hardware. The following are the TCP/IP model 
layers, starting from the bottom.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>TCP/IP MODEL</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The TCP/IP architectural model has four layers that 
approximately match six of the seven layers in the OSI Reference Model. The 
TCP/IP model does not address the physical layer, which is where hardware 
devices reside. The next three layers—<i>network interface</i>, <i>internet</i> 
and <i>(host-to-host) transport</i>—correspond to layers 2, 3 and 4 of the OSI 
model. The TCP/IP <i>application</i> layer conceptually “blurs” the top three 
OSI layers. It’s also worth noting that some people consider certain aspects of 
the OSI session layer to be arguably part of the TCP/IP host-to-host transport 
layer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><br>
</font>
<s2 align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Network Interface Layer</b></font></s2><font face="Arial">
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">As its name suggests, this layer represents 
the place where the actual TCP/IP protocols running at higher layers interface 
to the local network. This layer is somewhat “controversial” in that some people 
don't even consider it a “legitimate” part of TCP/IP. This is usually because 
none of the core IP protocols run at this layer. Despite this, the network 
interface layer is part of the architecture. It is equivalent to the </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#0101c0">data link layer (layer two) in the OSI 
Reference Model</font><font face="Arial"> and is also sometimes called the
<i>link layer</i>. You may also see the name <i>network access layer</i>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">On many TCP/IP networks, there is no TCP/IP 
protocol running at all on this layer, because it is simply not needed. For 
example, if you run TCP/IP over an Ethernet, then Ethernet handles layer two 
(and layer one) functions. However, the TCP/IP standards do define protocols for 
TCP/IP networks that do not have their own layer two implementation. These 
protocols, the </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#0101c0">Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and the 
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)</font><font face="Arial">, serve to fill the 
gap between the network layer and the physical layer. They are commonly used to 
facilitate TCP/IP over direct serial line connections (such as dial-up telephone 
networking) and other technologies that operate directly at the physical layer.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The TCP/IP model does not exactly match the OSI model. 
There is no universal agreement regarding how to describe TCP/IP with a layered 
model but it is generally agreed that there are fewer levels than the seven 
layers of the OSI model. Most descriptions present from three to five layers. In 
this technical reference document the layers of the TCP/IP model are defined as 
follows: </font></p>
<dl>
  <dt><font face="Arial"><b>Application Layer</b> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Arial">In TCP/IP the Application Layer also includes the OSI 
  Presentation Layer and Session Layer. In this document an application is any 
  process that occurs above the Transport Layer. This includes all of the 
  processes that involve user interaction. The application determines the 
  presentation of the data and controls the session. In TCP/IP the terms <b>
  socket</b> and <b>port</b> are used to describe the path over which 
  applications communicate. There are numerous application level protocols in 
  TCP/IP, including Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Post Office 
  Protocol (POP) used for e-mail, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used for 
  the World-Wide-Web, and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Most application level 
  protocols are associated with one or more port number. </font>
  <p>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font face="Arial"><b>Transport Layer</b> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Arial">In TCP/IP there are two Transport Layer protocols. The 
  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) guarantees that information is received as 
  it was sent. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) performs no end-to-end 
  reliability checks. </font>
  <p>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font face="Arial"><b>Internet Layer</b> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Arial">In the OSI Reference Model the Network Layer isolates 
  the upper layer protocols from the details of the underlying network and 
  manages the connections across the network. The Internet Protocol (IP) is 
  normally described as the TCP/IP Network Layer. Because of the 
  Inter-Networking emphasis of TCP/IP this is commonly referred to as the 
  Internet Layer. All upper and lower layer communications travel through IP as 
  they are passed through the TCP/IP protocol stack. </font>
  <p>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><font face="Arial"><b>Network Access Layer</b> </font></dt>
  <dd><font face="Arial">In TCP/IP the Data Link Layer and Physical Layer are 
  normally grouped together. TCP/IP makes use of existing Data Link and Physical 
  Layer standards rather than defining its own. Most RFCs that refer to the Data 
  Link Layer describe how IP utilizes existing data link protocols such as 
  Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI, HSSI, and ATM. The characteristics of the hardware 
  that carries the communication signal are typically defined by the Physical 
  Layer. This describes attributes such as pin configurations, voltage levels, 
  and cable requirements. Examples of Physical Layer standards are RS-232C, 
  V.35, and IEEE 802.3. </font>
  <p>&nbsp;</dd>
</dl>
<p><font face="Arial">The four layer structure of TCP/IP is built as information 
is passed down from applications to the physical network layer. When data is 
sent, each layer treats all of the information it receives from the layer above 
as data and adds control information to the front of that data. This control 
information is called a <b>header</b>, and the addition of a header is called <b>
encapsulation</b>. When data is received, the opposite procedure takes place as 
each layer removes its header before passing the data to the layer above. </font>

what the layer does, and not how entities above it access it or how the layer 
work. <br>
&nbsp;Interfaces : it tells the processes above it how to access it, and specifies 
parameters and results. <br>
<img src="sphere01.gif" width="14" height="14"><b> Protocol</b> : With this 
definition, the layer can characterize its own protocols, as many as he wants, 
and change them without affecting software in higher layers. </font></p>
