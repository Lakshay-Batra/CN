NETWORK</b></font></u></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">An ad-hoc (or &quot;spontaneous&quot;) network is a
local area network or other small network, especially one with
wireless or temporary plug-in connections, in which some of the network 
devices are part of the network only for the duration of a communications 
session or, in the case of mobile or portable devices, while in some close 
proximity to the rest of the network. In Latin, <i>ad hoc</i> literally means 
&quot;for this,&quot; further meaning &quot;for this purpose only,&quot; and thus usually temporary. 
The term has been applied to future office or home networks in which new devices 
can be quickly added, using, for example, the proposed
Bluetooth technology in which devices communicate with the computer and 
perhaps other devices using wireless transmission. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">One vendor offers an ad-hoc network 
technology that allows people to come to a conference room and, using
infrared transmission or radio frequency (RF) 
wireless signals, join their notebook computers with other conferees to a local 
network with shared data and printing resources. Each user has a unique network 
address that is immediately recognized as part of the network. The technology 
would also include remote users and hybrid wireless/wire connections.</font></p>

<span lang="EN">A <b>mobile ad-hoc network</b> (<b>MANET</b>) is a 
self-configuring
network of mobile
routers (and associated hosts) connected by
wireless links—the union of which form an arbitrary
topology. The routers are free to move randomly and organize themselves 
arbitrarily; thus, the network's wireless topology may change rapidly and 
unpredictably. Such a network may operate in a standalone fashion, or may be 
connected to the larger
Internet. Minimal configuration and quick deployment make ad hoc networks 
suitable for emergency situations like natural or human-induced disasters, 
military conflicts, emergency medical situations etc.</span></font></p>
<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span lang="EN">The earliest MANETs were called &quot;packet 
radio&quot; networks, and were sponsored by
DARPA in the early 1970s.
BBN Technologies and
SRI International designed, built, and experimented with these earliest 
systems. Experimenters included
Jerry Burchfiel,
Robert Kahn, and
Ray Tomlinson of later
TENEX,
Internet and
email fame. It is interesting to note that these early packet radio systems 
predated the
Internet, and indeed were part of the motivation of the original
Internet Protocol suite. Later DARPA experiments included the Survivable 
Radio Network (SURAN) 
project, which took place in the 1980s. Another third wave of academic activity 
started in the mid 1990s with the advent of inexpensive 802.11 radio cards for 
personal computers. Current MANETs are designed primarily for military utility; 
examples include
JTRS and
NTDR.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN">The popular
IEEE
802.11 (&quot;Wi-Fi&quot;) 
wireless protocol incorporates an ad-hoc networking system when no
wireless access points are present, although it would be considered a very 
low-grade ad-hoc protocol by specialists in the field. The IEEE 802.11 system 
only handles traffic within a local &quot;cloud&quot; of wireless devices. Each node 
transmits and receives data, but does not route anything between the network's 
systems. However, higher-level protocols can be used to aggregate various IEEE 
802.11 ad-hoc networks into MANETs.</span></font></p>

Connections</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><b>Key Considerations</b> - Using ad hoc
Wi-Fi mode eliminates the need for a
network router or
access point in a wireless home network. With ad hoc wireless, you can 
network computers together as needed without needing to be in reach of one 
central location. Most people use ad hoc Wi-Fi only in temporary situations to 
avoid potential security issues. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Optional Components</b> - Networking an ad hoc layout for Internet access, 
printers, or game consoles and other entertainment devices is not required for 
the rest of the home network to function. Simply omit any of these components 
shown that do not exist in your layout. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Limitations</b> - All devices connecting via ad hoc wireless must possess 
a working Wi-Fi
network adapter. These adapters must be configured for &quot;ad hoc&quot; mode instead 
of the more typical &quot;infrastructure&quot; mode. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">Because of their more flexible design, ad hoc Wi-Fi networks are also more 
difficult to keep secure than those using central wireless routers / access 
points. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">Ad hoc Wi-Fi networks support a maximum of 11
Mbps bandwidth, while other Wi-Fi networks may support 54 Mbps or higher.</font></p>
