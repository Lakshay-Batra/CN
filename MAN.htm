</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Arial">A Metropolitan Area Network 
(MAN) is a large computer network on the large geographical area that include 
several buildings or even the entire city (metropolis). The geographical area of 
the MAN is larger than LAN, but smaller than WAN. MAN includes many 
communicating devices and provides the Internet connectivity for the LANs in the 
metropolitan area.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Arial">MAN is used to combine into a 
network group located in different buildings into a single network. The diameter 
of such a network can range from 5 to 50 kilometers. As a rule, MAN does not 
belong to any particular organization, in most cases, a group of users or a 
provider who takes charge for the service own its connecting elements and other 
equipment. Level of service is agreed in advance and some warranties are 
discussed. MAN often acts as a high-speed network to allow sharing regional 
resources (like a big LAN). It is also often used to provide public available 
connection to other networks using a WAN connection. There are many ways of 
classifying networks. The main criterion for classification is considering the 
administration method. That is, depending on how the network is organized and 
how it is controlled, it can be attributed to local or distributed, metropolitan 
or WAN. or her A network administrator manages a network or it’s segment. 
Administration team activities are logged, and their rights and responsibilities 
are strictly divided if the network is complex. Computers can be connected using 
a variety of media access controllers: a twisted pair, optical conductors 
(optical cables) and via radio (wireless technology). Wired optical connections 
are usually established via Ethernet, wireless - through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS 
and other protocols. Private LAN may be linked to other local area networks 
through gateways, as well as being part of a global computer network (eg, the 
Internet), or have a connection to it.</font></p>

metropolitan area network (MAN) </b>is a network that interconnects users with 
computer resources in a geographic area or region larger than that covered by 
even a large local area network (LAN) but smaller than the area covered by a 
wide area network (WAN). The term is applied to the interconnection of networks 
in a city into a single larger network (which may then also offer efficient 
connection to a wide area network). It is also used to mean the interconnection 
of several local area networks by bridging them with backbone lines. The latter 
usage is also sometimes referred to as a campus network.</span></font></p>
