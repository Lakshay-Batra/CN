<font face="Arial" size="5" color="#FF0000">CIRCUIT SWITCHING</font></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">One fundamental way of differentiating 
networking technologies is on the basis of the method they use to determine the 
path between devices over which information will flow. In highly simplified 
terms, there are two approaches: either a path can be set up between the devices 
in advance, or the data can be sent as individual data elements over a variable 
path.</font></p>
<p>
<s1 align="left"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Circuit Switching</i></b></font></s1><font face="Arial">
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In this networking method, a connection 
called a <i>circuit</i> is set up between two devices, which is used for the 
whole communication. Information about the nature of the circuit is maintained 
by the network. The circuit may either be a fixed one that is always present, or 
it may be a circuit that is created on an as-needed basis. Even if many 
potential paths through intermediate devices may exist between the two devices 
communicating, only one will be used for any given dialog. This is illustrated 
in </font>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>Fgure 1: Circuit Switching</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In a circuit-switched network, before communication can 
occur between two devices, a circuit is established between them. This is shown 
as a thick blue line for the conduit of data from Device <i>A</i> to Device <i>B</i>, 
and a matching purple line from <i>B</i> back to <i>A</i>. Once set up, all 
communication between these devices takes place over this circuit, even though 
there are other possible ways that data could conceivably be passed over the 
network of devices between them. Contrast this diagram to </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#0000ff">Figure 2</font><font face="Arial">.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The classic example of a circuit-switched 
network is the telephone system. When you call someone and they answer, you 
establish a circuit connection and can pass data between you, in a steady stream 
if desired. That circuit functions the same way regardless of how many 
intermediate devices are used to carry your voice. You use it for as long as you 
need it, and then terminate the circuit. The next time you call, you get a new 
circuit, which may (probably will) use different hardware than the first circuit 
did, depending on what's available at that time in the network.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Packet Switching</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In this network type, no specific path is 
used for data transfer. Instead, the data is chopped up into small pieces called
<i>packets</i> and sent over the network. The packets can be routed, combined or 
fragmented, as required to get them to their eventual destination. On the 
receiving end, the process is reversed—the data is read from the packets and 
re-assembled into the form of the original data. A packet-switched network is 
more analogous to the postal system than it is to the telephone system (though 
the comparison isn't perfect.) An example is shown in </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#0000ff">Figure 2</font><font face="Arial">.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>Figure 2: Packet Switching</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">In a packet-switched network, no circuit is 
set up prior to sending data between devices. Blocks of data, even from the same 
file or communication, may take any number of paths as it journeys from one 
device to another. Compare this to </font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Comparing Circuit Switching and Packet 
Switching</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A common temptation when considering 
alternatives such as these is to ask which is “better”—and as usually is the 
case, the answer is “neither”. There are places where one is more suited than 
the other, but if one were clearly superior, both methods wouldn't be used.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">One important issue in selecting a switching 
method is whether the network medium is <i>shared</i> or <i>dedicated</i>. Your 
phone line can be used for establishing a circuit because you are the only one 
who can use it—assuming you can keep that pesky 
wife/husband/child/sister/brother/father/mother off the phone.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">However, this doesn't work well in LANs, 
which typically use a single shared medium and baseband signaling. If two 
devices were to establish a connection, they would “lock out” all the other 
devices for a long period of time. It makes more sense to chop the data into 
small pieces and send them one at a time. Then, if two other devices want to 
communicate, <i>their</i> packets can be interspersed and everyone can share the 
network.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The ability to have many devices communicate 
simultaneously without dedicated data paths is one reason why packet switching 
is becoming predominant today. However, there are some disadvantages of packet 
switching compared to circuit switching. One is that since all data does not 
take the same, predictable path between devices, it is possible that some pieces 
of data may get lost in transit, or show up in the incorrect order. In some 
situations this does not matter, while in others it is very important indeed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">While the theoretical difference between 
circuit and packet switching is pretty clear-cut, understanding how they are 
used is a bit more complicated. One of the major issues is that in modern 
networks, they are often combined. For example, suppose you connect to the 
Internet using a dial-up modem. You will be using IP datagrams (packets) to 
carry higher-layer data, but it will be over the circuit-switched telephone 
network. Yet the data may be sent over the telephone system in digital 
packetized form. So in some ways, both circuit switching and packet switching 
are being used concurrently.</font></p>
<h1><font face="Arial" size="3">Circuit Switching</font></h1>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">A type of communications in which a dedicated 
channel (or <i>circuit</i>) is established for the duration of a transmission. 
The most ubiquitous circuit-switching network is the telephone

<span style="color:#333333">system</span></a>, which links together wire 
segments to create a single unbroken line for each telephone call. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The other common communications method is 
packet switching, which divides messages into packets and sends each packet 
individually. The Internet is based on a packet-switching protocol, TCP/IP.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Circuit-switching systems are ideal for 
communications that require data to be transmitted in real-time. 
Packet-switching networks are more efficient if some amount of delay is 
acceptable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Circuit-switching networks are sometimes 
called <i>connection-oriented</i> networks. Note, however, that although packet 
switching is essentially connectionless, a packet switching network can be made 
connection-oriented by using a higher-level protocol. TCP, for example, makes IP 
networks connection-oriented.</span></p>
<span id="intelliTxt">
<font face="Arial">
<p>The three most common switch methods are:</p>
<p>1. <b>Cut-through&nbsp;-</b> Streams data so that the first part of a packet exits 
the switch before the rest of the packet has finished entering the switch, 
typically within the first 12 bytes of an Ethernet frame. </p>
<p>2. <b>Store-and-Forward&nbsp;-</b> The entire frame is copied into the switch's 
memory buffer and it stays there while the switch processes the Cyclical 
Redundancy Check (CRC) to look for errors in the frame. If the frame contains no 
errors, it will be forwarded. If a frame contains an error, it will be dropped. 
Obviously, this method has higher latency than cut-through but there will be no 
fragments or bad frames taking up bandwidth. </p>
<p>3. <b>Fragment-free Switching</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Think of this as a hybrid of cut-through 
and store-and-forward. The switch reads only the first 64 bytes of the frame 
into buffer before forwarding it (think of a truck...<br>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Packet Swiching</font></b></p>
</span>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Refers to protocols in which messages are 
divided into packets before they are sent. Each packet is then transmitted 
individually and can even follow different routes to its destination. Once all 
the packets forming a message arrive at the destination, they are recompiled 
into the original message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Most modern Wide Area Network (WAN) 
protocols, including TCP/IP, X.25, and Frame Relay, are based on 
packet-switching technologies. In contrast, normal telephone service is based on 
a circuit-switching technology, in which a dedicated line is allocated for 
transmission between two parties. Circuit-switching is ideal when data must be 
transmitted quickly and must arrive in the same order in which it's sent. This 
is the case with most real-time data, such as live audio and video. Packet 
switching is more efficient and robust for data that can withstand some delays 
in transmission, such as e-mail messages and Web pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">A new technology, ATM, attempts to combine 
the best of both worlds -- the guaranteed delivery of circuit-switched networks 
and the robustness and efficiency of packet-switching networks.</span>&nbsp;</p>
