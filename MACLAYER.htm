<h1><font size="3" face="Arial">Medium Access Control (MAC)</font></h1>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is used 
to provide the data link layer of the </font><font size="3">
<font face="Arial">Ethernet LAN system. The MAC 
protocol encapsulates a SDU (payload 
data) by adding a 14 byte header (Protocol Control Information (PCI)) before the 
data and appending a 4-byte (32-bit) Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) 
after the data. The entire frame is preceded by a small idle period (the minimum 
inter-frame gap, 9.6 microsecond (µS)) and a 8 byte preamble.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Preamble</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The purpose of the idle time before transmission starts is 
to allow a small time interval for the receiver electronics in each of the nodes 
to settle after completion of the previous frame. A node starts transmission by 
sending an 8 byte (64 bit) preamble sequence. This consists of 62 alternating 
1's and 0's followed by the pattern 11. Strictly speaking the last byte which 
finished with the '11' is known as the &quot;Start of Frame Delimiter&quot;. When encoded 
using Manchester encoding, at 10 Mbps, the 62 alternating bits produce a 5 MHz 
square wave.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The purpose of the preamble is to allow time for the 
receiver in each node to achieve lock of the receiver Digital Phase Lock Loop which 
is used to synchronise the receive data clock to the transmit data clock. At the 
point when the first bit of the preamble is received, each receiver may be in an 
arbitrary state (i.e. have an arbitrary phase for its local clock). During the 
course of the preamble it learns the correct phase, but in so doing it may miss 
(or gain) a number of bits. A special pattern (11), is therefore used to mark 
the last two bits of the preamble. When this is received, the Ethernet receive 
interface starts collecting the bits into bytes for processing by the MAC layer.</font></p>

</center>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The header 
consists of three parts:</span></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">A 6-byte destination address, which specifies 
  either a single recipient node (unicast mode), a group of recipient nodes 
  (multicast mode), or the set of all recipient nodes (broadcast mode). </span>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">A 6-byte source address, which is set to the 
  sender's globally unique node address. This may be used by the network layer 
  protocol to identify the sender, but usually other mechanisms are used (e.g. 
  arp). Its main function is to allow address learning which may be used to 
  configure the filter tables in a bridge. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">A 2-byte type field, which provides a Service 
  Access Point (SAP) to identify the type of protocol being carried (e.g. the 
  values 0x0800 is used to identify the IP network protocol, other values are 
  used to indicate other network layer protocols). In the case of IEEE 802.3 
  LLC, this may also be used to indicate the length of the data part. The type 
  field is also be used to indicate when a Tag field is added to a frame.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">
&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial"><b>CRC</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The 32-bit CRC</font></font><font size="3" face="Arial"> 
added at the end of the frame provides error detection in the case where line 
errors (or transmission collisions in Ethernet) result in corruption of the MAC 
frame. Any frame with an invalid CRC is discarded by the MAC receiver without 
further processing. The MAC protocol does not provide any indication that a 
frame has been discarded due to an invalid CRC.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Inter Frame Gap</font></h4>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">After transmission of each frame, a transmitter 
must wait for a period of 9.6 microseconds (at 10 Mbps) to allow the signal to 
propagate through the receiver electronics at the destination. This period of 
time is known as the Inter-Frame Gap (IFG). While every transmitter must wait 
for this time between sending frames, receivers do not necessarily see a 
&quot;silent&quot; period of 9.6 microseconds. The way in which repeaters operate is such 
that they may reduce the IFG between the frames which they regenerate.</font><font size="3"></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Byte Order</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It is important to realise that nearly all serial 
communications systems transmit the least significant bit of 
each byte first at the physical layer. Ethernet supports broadcast, unicast, and 
multicast addresses. The appearance of a multicast address on the cable (in this 
case an IP</font></font><font size="3" face="Arial"> multicast 
address, with group set to the bit pattern 0xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx) is 
therefore as shown below (bits transmitted from left to right):</font></p>
<pre><font face="Arial">    0                           23 IP Multicast Address Group  47
    |                           | &lt;---------------------------&gt;|
    1000 0000 0000 0000 0111 1010 xxxx xxx0 xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

                                          1 = Assigned for other uses</font></pre>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">However, when the same frame is stored in the 
memory of a computer, the bits are ordered such that the least significant bit 
of each byte is stored in the right most position (bits transmitted 
right-to-left within octets, octets transmitted left-to-right):</font></p>
<pre><font face="Arial">    0                           23                            47

<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">A Runt Frame</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Any frame which is received and which is less 
than 64 bytes is illegal, and is called a &quot;runt&quot;. In most cases, such frames 
arise from a collision, and while they indicate an illegal reception, they may 
be observed on correctly functioning networks. A receiver must discard all runt 
frames.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">A Giant Frame</font></h3>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Any frame which is received and which is greater 
than the maximum frame size, is called a &quot;giant&quot;. In theory, the </font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">jabber control circuit 
in the transceiver should prevent any node from generating such a frame, but 
certain failures in the physical layer may also give rise to over-sized Ethernet 
frames. Like runts, giants are discarded by an Ethernet receiver.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">A Misaligned Frame</font></h3>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Any frame which does not contain an integral 
number of received octets (bytes) is also illegal. A receiver has no way of 
knowing which bits are legal, and how to compute the CRC-32 of the frame. Such 
frames are therefore also discarded by the Ethernet receiver.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">
Other Issues</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">
<font size="3">The Ethernet standard dictates a minimum size of frame, which 
requires at least 46 bytes of data to be present in every MAC frame. If the 
network layer wishes to send less than 46 bytes of data the MAC protocol adds 
sufficient number of zero bytes (0x00, is also known as null padding characters) 
to satisfy this requirement. The maximum size of data which may be carried in a 
MAC frame using Ethernet is 1500 bytes (this is known as the MTU in IP).</font></span><font size="3"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">
A protocol known as the &quot;Address Resolution Protocol&quot; (arp) is used to identify 
the MAC source address of remote computers when IP is used over an Ethernet LAN.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">
Exception to the Rule</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"></font>
<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">An extension to Ethernet, known 
as IEEE 802.1p allows for frames to carry a tag. The tag value adds an extra 
level of PCI to the Ethernet frame header. This increases the size of the total 
MAC frame when the tag is used. A side effect of this is that NICs and network 
devices designed to support this extension require a modification to the jabber 
detection circuit.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">
&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Medium access basics</font></h3>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Before transmitting frames, a station must first 
gain access to the medium, which is a radio channel that stations share. The 
802.11 standard defines two forms of medium access, distributed coordination 
function (DCF) and point coordination function (PCF). DCF is mandatory and based 
on the CSMA/CA (carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) 
protocol. With DCF, 802.11 stations contend for access and attempt to send 
frames when there is no other station transmitting. If another station is 
sending a frame, stations are polite and wait until the channel is free.</font><font size="3"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As a condition to accessing the medium, the MAC Layer 
checks the value of its network allocation vector (NAV), which is a counter 
resident at each station that represents the amount of time that the previous 
frame needs to send its frame. The NAV must be zero before a station can attempt 
to send a frame. Prior to transmitting a frame, a station calculates the amount 
of time necessary to send the frame based on the frame's length and data rate. 
The station places a value representing this time in the duration field in the 
header of the frame. When stations receive the frame, they examine this duration 
field value and use it as the basis for setting their corresponding NAVs. This 
process reserves the medium for the sending station.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">An important aspect of the DCF is a random back off timer 
that a station uses if it detects a busy medium. If the channel is in use, the 
station must wait a <i>random</i> period of time before attempting to access the 
medium again. This ensures that multiple stations wanting to send data don't 
transmit at the same time. The random delay causes stations to wait different 
periods of time and avoids all of them sensing the medium at exactly the same 
time, finding the channel idle, transmitting, and colliding with each other. The 
back off timer significantly reduces the number of collisions and corresponding 
retransmissions, especially when the number of active users increases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With radio-based LANs, a transmitting station can't listen 
for collisions while sending data, mainly because the station can't have it's 
receiver on while transmitting the frame. As a result, the receiving station 
needs to send an acknowledgement (ACK) if it detects no errors in the received 
frame. If the sending station doesn't receive an ACK after a specified period of 
time, the sending station will assume that there was a collision (or RF 
interference) and retransmit the frame. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For supporting time-bounded delivery of data frames, the 
802.11 standard defines the optional point coordination function (PCF) where the 
access point grants access to an individual station to the medium by polling the 
station during the contention free period. Stations can't transmit frames unless 
the access point polls them first. The period of time for PCF-based data traffic 
(if enabled) occurs alternately between contention (DCF) periods. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The access point polls stations according to a polling 
list, then switches to a contention period when stations use DCF. This process 
enables support for both synchronous (i.e., video applications) and asynchronous 
(i.e., e-mail and Web browsing applications) modes of operation. </font></p>
<p></font><font size="3" face="Arial">No known wireless NICs or access points on 
the market today, however, implement PCF.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">802.11 MAC Layer Functions</font></h3>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The following summarizes primary 802.11 MAC 
functions, especially as they relate to infrastructure wireless LANs:</font><font size="3"></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>Scanning</b>: The 802.11 standard defines both 
  passive and active scanning; whereby, a radio NIC searches for access points. 
  Passive scanning is mandatory where each NIC scans individual channels to find 
  the best access point signal. Periodically, access points broadcast a beacon, 
  and the radio NIC receives these beacons while scanning and takes note of the 
  corresponding signal strengths. The beacons contain information about the 
  access point, including service set identifier (SSID), 
  supported data rates, etc. The radio NIC can use this information along with 
  the signal strength to compare access points and decide upon which one to use. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial">Optional active scanning is similar, except the radio 
  NIC initiates the process by broadcasting a probe frame, and all access points 
  within range respond with a probe response. Active scanning enables a radio 
  NIC to receive immediate response from access points, without waiting for a 
  beacon transmission. The issue, however, is that active scanning imposes 
  additional overhead on the network because of the transmission of probe and 
  corresponding response frames.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>Authentication</b>: Authentication is the process of 
  proving identity, and the 802.11 standard specifies two forms: Open system 
  authentication and shared key authentication. Open system authentication is 
  mandatory, and it's a two step process. A radio NIC first initiates the 
  process by sending an authentication request frame to the access point. The 
  access point replies with an authentication response frame containing approval 
  or disapproval of authentication indicated in the Status Code field in the 
  frame body. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial">Shared key authentication is an optional four step 
  process that bases authentication on whether the authenticating device has the 
  correct WEP (wired equivalent 
  privacy) key. The radio NIC starts by sending an authentication request frame 
  to the access point. The access point then places challenge text into the 
  frame body of a response frame and sends it to the radio NIC. The radio NIC 
  uses its WEP key to encrypt the challenge text and then sends it back to the 
  access point in another authentication frame. The access point decrypts the 
  challenge text and compares it to the initial text. If the text is equivalent, 
  then the access point assumes that the radio NIC has the correct key. The 
  access point finishes the sequence by sending an authentication frame to the 
  radio NIC with the approval or disapproval. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>Association</b>: Once authenticated, the radio NIC 
  must associate with the access point before sending data frames. Association 
  is necessary to synchronize the radio NIC and access point with important 
  information, such as supported data rates. The radio NIC initiates the 
  association by sending an association request frame containing elements such 
  as SSID and supported data rates. The access point responds by sending an 
  association response frame containing an association ID along with other 
  information regarding the access point. Once the radio NIC and access point 
  complete the association process, they can send data frames to each other.
  </font></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>WEP</b>: With the optional WEP enabled, the wireless 
  NIC will encrypt the body (not header) of each frame before transmission using 
  a common key, and the receiving station will decrypt the frame upon receipt 
  using the common key. The 802.11 standard specifies a 40-bit key and no key 
  distribution method, which makes 802.11 wireless LANs vulnerable to 
  eavesdroppers. The 802.11i committee, however, is improving 802.11 security by 
  incorporating </font>
  <a href="http://www.80211-planet.com/tutorials/article/0,4000,10724_1041171,00.html">
  <font face="Arial">802.1X</font></a><font face="Arial"> and stronger 
  encryption into the standard. </font></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>RTS/CTS</b>: The optional request-to send and 
  clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) function allows the access point to control use of the 
  medium for stations activating RTS/CTS. With most radio NICs, users can set a 
  maximum frame length threshold whereby the radio NIC will activate RTS/CTS. 
  For example, a frame length of 1,000 bytes will trigger RTS/CTS for all frames 
  larger than 1,000 bytes. The use of RTS/CTS alleviates hidden node problems, 
  that is, where two or more radio NICs can't hear each other and they are 
  associated with the same access point. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial">If the radio NIC activates RTS/CTS, it will first send a 
  RTS frame to access point before sending a data frame. The access point will 
  then respond with a CTS frame, indicating that the radio NIC can send the data 
  frame. With the CTS frame, the access point will provide a value in the 
  duration field of the frame header that holds off other stations from 
  transmitting until after the radio NIC initiating the RTS can send its data 
  frame. This avoids collisions between hidden nodes. The RTS/CTS handshake 
  continues for each frame, as long as the frame size exceeds the threshold set 
  in the corresponding radio NIC. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"><b>Power Save Mode:</b> The optional power save mode that a user 
  can turn on or off enables the radio NIC to conserve battery power when there 
  is no need to send data. With power save mode on, the radio NIC indicates its 
  desire to enter &quot;sleep&quot; state to the access point via a status bit located in 
  the header of each frame. The access point takes note of each radio NIC 
  wishing to enter power save mode, and buffers packets corresponding to the 
  sleeping station. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial">In order to still receive data frames, the sleeping NIC 
  must wake up periodically (at the right time) to receive regular beacon 
  transmissions coming from the access point. These beacons identify whether 
  sleeping stations have frames buffered at the access point and waiting for 
  delivery to their respective destinations. The radio NICs having awaiting 
  frames will request them from the access point. After receiving the frames, 
  the radio NIC can go back to sleep.</font></li>
  <li></font><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Fragmentation</b>: The optional 
  fragmentation function enables an 802.11 station to divide data packets into 
  smaller frames. This is done to avoid needing to retransmit large frames in 
  the presence of RF interference. The bits errors resulting from RF 
  interference are likely to affect a single frame, and it requires less 
  overhead to retransmit a smaller frame rather than a larger one. As with RTS/CTS, 
  users can generally set a maximum frame length threshold whereby the radio NIC 
  will activate fragmentation. If the frame size is larger than the threshold, 
  the radio NIC will break the packet into multiple frames, with each frame no 
  larger than the threshold value. </font></li>
