data between a Standards-based or platform independent formats to a format 
understood by the local machine. This allows for data to be transported between 
devices and still be understood.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The <i>presentation layer</i> is the sixth 
  layer of the OSI Reference Model protocol stack, and second from the top. It 
  is different from the other layers in two key respects. First, it has a much 
  more limited and specific function than the other layers; it's actually 
  somewhat easy to describe, hurray! Second, it is used much less often than the 
  other layers; in many types of connections it is not required.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The name of this layer suggests its main 
  function as well: it deals with the <i>presentation </i>of data. More 
  specifically, the presentation layer is charged with taking care of any issues 
  that might arise where data sent from one system needs to be viewed in a 
  different way by the other system. It also takes care of any special 
  processing that must be done to data from the time an application tries to 
  send it until the time it is sent over the network.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Here are some of the specific types of data 
  handling issues that the presentation layer handles:</font><ul type="circle">
    <li><font face="Arial"><b>Translation:</b> Networks can connect very 
    different types of
    <font style="font-weight: 400; color: blue; font-family: Arial; position: relative" color="blue">
    <span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; color: blue; font-family: Arial; position: relative">
    computers</span></font> together: PCs, Macintoshes, UNIX systems, AS/400 
    servers and mainframes can all exist on the same network. These systems have 
    many distinct characteristics and represent data in different ways; they may 
    use different character sets for example. The presentation layer handles the 
    job of hiding these differences between machines. <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"><b>Compression:</b> Compression (and decompression) 
    may be done at the presentation layer to improve the throughput of data. 
    (There are some who believe this is not, strictly speaking, a function of 
    the presentation layer.) <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial"><b>Encryption:</b> Some types of encryption (and 
    decryption) are performed at the presentation layer. This ensures the 
    security of the data as it travels down the protocol stack. For example, one 
    of the most popular encryption schemes that is usually associated with the 
    presentation layer is the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Not all 
    encryption is done at layer 6, however; some encryption is often done at 
    lower layers in the protocol stack, in

  Model</i></b></font></s1><font face="Arial"> </font> </p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The reason that the presentation layer is 
  not always used in network communications is that the jobs mentioned above are 
  simply not always needed. Compression and encryption are usually considered 
  “optional”, and translation features are also only needed in certain 
  circumstances. Another reason why the presentation layer is sometimes not 
  mentioned is that its functions may be performed as part of the application 
  layer.</font></li>
