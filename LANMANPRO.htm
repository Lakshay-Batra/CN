<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">LAN</span> is a high-speed 
data network that covers a relatively small geographic area. It typically 
connects workstations, personal computers, printers, servers, and other devices. 
LANs offer computer users many advantages, including shared access to devices 
and applications, file exchange between connected users, and communication 
between users via electronic mail and other applications. </font></p>

</font><span id="intelliTxt" nd="1"><font face="Arial">A computer network that 
spans a relatively small area. Most LANs are confined to a single building or 
group of buildings. However, one LAN can be connected to other LANs over any 
distance via telephone lines and radio waves. A system of LANs connected in this 
way is called a <i>wide-area network (WAN)</i>. </font></p>
<p nd="2" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Most LANs connect workstations and 
personal computers. Each <i>node</i> (individual computer ) in a LAN has its own 
CPU with which it executes programs, but it also is able to access data and 
devices anywhere on the LAN. This means that many users can share expensive 
devices, such as laser printers, as well as data. Users can also use the LAN to 
communicate with each other, by sending e-mail or engaging in chat sessions.
</font></p>
<p nd="3" align="justify"><font face="Arial">There are many different types of 
LANs <i>Ethernets</i> being the most common for PCs. Most Apple Macintosh 
networks are based on Apple's AppleTalk network system, which is built into 
Macintosh computers. </font></p>
<p nd="4" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The following characteristics 
differentiate one LAN from another: </font></p>
<menu>
  <li nd="5">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">topology : The geometric arrangement of 
  devices on the network. For example, devices can be arranged in a ring or in a 
  straight line. </font></li>
  <li nd="6">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">protocols : The rules and encoding 
  specifications for sending data. The protocols also determine whether the 
  network uses a peer-to-peer or client/server architecture. </font></li>
  <li nd="7">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">media : Devices can be connected by 
  twisted-pair wire, coaxial cables, or fiber optic cables. Some networks do 
  without connecting media altogether, communicating instead via radio waves.
  </font></li>
</menu>
<p nd="8" align="justify"><font face="Arial">LANs are capable of transmitting 
data at very fast rates, much faster than data can be transmitted over a 
telephone line; but the distances are limited, and there is also a limit on the 
number of computers that can be attached to a single LAN. </font></p>

layers of the OSI reference model, as discussed in Chapter 1, &quot;Internetworking 
Basics,&quot; between the physical layer and the data link layer. Figure 2-2

<h2 class="p_H_Head1"><font size="4" face="Arial">LAN Media-Access Methods
</font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Media contention occurs when two or more 
network devices have data to send at the same time. Because multiple devices 
cannot talk on the network simultaneously, some type of method must be used to 
allow one device access to the network media at a time. This is done in two main 
ways: carrier sense multiple access collision detect (CSMA/CD) and token 
passing. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">In networks using
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">CSMA/CD</span> technology 
such as Ethernet, network devices contend for the network media. When a device 
has data to send, it first listens to see if any other device is currently using 
the network. If not, it starts sending its data. After finishing its 
transmission, it listens again to see if a collision occurred. A collision 
occurs when two devices send data simultaneously. When a collision happens, each 
device waits a random length of time before resending its data. In most cases, a 
collision will not occur again between the two devices. Because of this type of 
network contention, the busier a network becomes, the more collisions occur. 
This is why performance of Ethernet degrades rapidly as the number of devices on 
a single network increases. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">In<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic"> 
token-passing</span> networks such as Token Ring and FDDI, a special network 
frame called a token is passed around the network from device to device. When a 
device has data to send, it must wait until it has the token and then sends its 
data. When the data transmission is complete, the token is released so that 
other devices may use the network media. The main advantage of token-passing 
networks is that they are deterministic. In other words, it is easy to calculate 
the maximum time that will pass before a device has the opportunity to send 
data. This explains the popularity of token-passing networks in some real-time 
environments such as factories, where machinery must be capable of communicating 
at a determinable interval. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">For CSMA/CD networks, switches segment 
the network into multiple collision domains. This reduces the number of devices 
per network segment that must contend for the media. By creating smaller 
collision domains, the performance of a network can be increased significantly 
without requiring addressing changes. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Normally CSMA/CD networks are 
half-duplex, meaning that while a device sends information, it cannot receive at 
the time. While that device is talking, it is incapable of also listening for 
other traffic. This is much like a walkie-talkie. When one person wants to talk, 
he presses the transmit button and begins speaking. While he is talking, no one 
else on the same frequency can talk. When the sending person is finished, he 
releases the transmit button and the frequency is available to others. </font>
</p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">When switches are introduced, 
full-duplex operation is possible. Full-duplex works much like a telephone—you 
can listen as well as talk at the same time. When a network device is attached 
directly to the port of a network switch, the two devices may be capable of 
operating in full-duplex mode. In full-duplex mode, performance can be 
increased, but <br>
not quite as much as some like to claim. A 100-Mbps Ethernet segment is capable 
of transmitting 200 Mbps of data, but only 100 Mbps can travel in one direction 
at a time. Because most data connections are asymmetric (with more data 
traveling in one direction than the other), the gain is not as great as many 
claim. However, full-duplex operation does increase the throughput of most 
applications because the network media is no longer shared. Two devices on a 
full-duplex connection can send data as soon as it is ready. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Token-passing networks such as Token 
Ring can also benefit from network switches. In large networks, the delay 
between turns to transmit may be significant because the token is passed around 
the network. </font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="5" face="Arial">WAN</font></b></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">A
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">WAN</span> is a data 
communications network that covers a relatively broad geographic area and that 
often uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as 
telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three 
layers of the OSI reference model: the physical layer, the data link layer, and 
the network layer. Figure 3-1 illustrates the relationship between the common 
WAN technologies and the OSI model. </font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial">Protocols Used on WANs</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">There are many different types of protocols used 
throughout the world, depending on location, type of WAN, and administrator 
knowledge. These protocols all operate at layer 2 (at least) of the OSI model 
(data-link layer). We will briefly review them here, and other chapters will 
dedicate more discussion to the more common of them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) </b>PPP is used with both 
dedicated lines and circuit-switched networks. It is a standard protocol that 
vendors can use to interoperate their equipment with other vendors. In addition, 
PPP supports multiple network layer protocols such as TCP/IP and IPX/SPX, as 
well as authentication and compression mechanisms. Because PPP is such a 
versatile protocol, we will examine it more thoroughly in later chapters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) </b>One of the 
earliest protocols used in point-to-point connections, SLIP is being phased out 
due to some of its serious drawbacks. These drawbacks include support only for 
TCP/IP and lack of security. SLIP can be used over dedicated and 
circuit-switched networks. We will not examine SLIP in this book.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) </b>Although HDLC 
is a standard, the limiting factor of that standard is the support for only a 
single protocol. Because of this, Cisco has modified it to support multiple 
protocols over point-to-point links. This is the default encapsulation protocol 
on serial links with Cisco routers. Because of this modification, though, Cisco 
products may not interoperate with other vendors' equipment. In this situation, 
PPP is the better protocol. HDLC is supported over dedicated lines, but not over 
circuit-switched or packet-switched networks. HDLC is a simple protocol, and 
therefore we will not examine it in much more detail in this book.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Frame Relay (FR) </b>Frame Relay was a protocol derived 
from ISDN specifications and has evolved to become the dominant layer 2 protocol 
over packet-switched networks. As a standard, it has become widely available 
throughout the United States and many other parts of the world. Frame Relay is a 
protocol that should be thoroughly understood, and so we will examine it in 
later chapters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>X.25 </b>X.25 protocol is an older protocol that can 
still be found throughout the world. It is also a protocol that is used over 
packet-switched networks. The primary difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is 
the overhead of error correction built into X.25. This overhead was a necessary 
feature of the older, less reliable networks and networks still found in more 
remote parts of the world. Although it is an older protocol, it does have a 
large install base worldwide, and therefore we will examine it in more detail in 
a later chapter.</font></p>
