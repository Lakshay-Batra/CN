<font face="Arial" size="6" color="#FF0000"><span lang="EN"><b>Open Shortest 
Path First Protocol</b></span></font></span></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">The <b>Open Shortest Path 
First</b> (<b>OSPF</b>) protocol is a hierarchical interior gateway protocol (IGP) 
for routing in Internet Protocol, using a link-state in the individual <i>areas</i> 
that make up the hierarchy. A computation based on Dijkstra's algorithm is used 
to calculate the shortest path tree inside each area. The current version, 
Version 3, defined in RFC 2740 <cite>(OSPFv3 1999)</cite>, supports IPv6 only, 
while OSPF version 2 supports IPv4. <cite>(OSPFv2 1998)</cite>.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">A link state database (LSDB) 
is constructed as a tree-image of the network topology, and identical copies of 
the LSDB are periodically updated on all routers in each OSPF-aware area (region 
of the network included in an OSPF area type - see &quot;Area types&quot; below). By 
convention, area 0 represents the core or &quot;backbone&quot; region of an OSPF-enabled 
network, and other OSPF area numbers may be designated to serve other regions of 
an enterprise (large, business) network - however every additional OSPF area 
must have a direct or virtual connection to the backbone OSPF area. The backbone 
area has the identifier 0.0.0.0. Inter-area routing goes via the backbone.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">OSPF is perhaps the most 
widely-used IGP in large enterprise networks; IS-IS is more common in large 
service provider networks. The most widely-used <i>exterior gateway protocol</i> 
(<i>EGP</i>) is BGP. The OSPF Protocol can operate (communicate with other 
routers about &quot;best-path&quot; routes to save in their LSDBs) securely, optionally 
using a cleartext password or using MD5 to authenticate peers before forming 
adjacencies, and before accepting link-state advertisements (LSA). A natural 
successor to the <i>Routing Information Protocol</i> (RIP), it was <i>classless</i> 
- or able to use Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) - from its inception. 
Multicast extensions to OSPF, the <i>Multicast Open Shortest Path First</i> (MOSPF) 
protocols, have been defined but these are not widely used at present.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Routers in the same 
broadcast domain or at each end of a point-to-point telecommunications link form
<i>adjacencies</i> when they have detected each other. This detection occurs 
when a router &quot;sees&quot; itself in a hello packet. This is called a two way state 
and is the most basic relationship. The routers elect a <i>designated router</i> 
(DR) and a <i>backup designated router</i> (BDR) which act as a hub to reduce 
traffic between routers. OSPF uses both unicast and multicast to send &quot;hello 
packets&quot; and link state updates. Multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 (all SPF/link 
state routers) and 224.0.0.6 (all Designated Routers) are reserved for OSPF. In 
contrast to the <i>Routing Information Protocol</i> (RIP) or the <i>Border 
Gateway Protocol</i> (BGP), OSPF does not use TCP or UDP but uses IP directly, 
via IP protocol 89. OSPF handles its own error detection and correction, 
therefore negating the need for TCP or UDP functions.</span></font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN"><font size="3">
Area types</font></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">An OSPF network is divided 
into <i>areas</i>, which have 32-bit area identifiers commonly, but not always, 
written in the dotted decimal format of an IP address. Area identifiers are <i>
not</i> IP addresses and may duplicate, without conflict, any IP address. While 
most OSPF implementations will right-justify an area number written in other 
than dotted decimal format (e.g., area 1), it is wise always to use dotted 
decimal formats. Most implementations would expand area 1 to the area identifier 
0.0.0.1, but some have been known to expand it as 1.0.0.0.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">These are logical 
groupings of routers whose information may be summarized towards the rest of the 
network. Several &quot;special&quot; area types are defined:</span></font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
<span lang="EN">Backbone area</span></span></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">The backbone area (also 
known as <i>area zero</i> or <i>area 0.0.0.0</i>) forms the core of an OSPF 
network. All other areas are connected to it, and inter-area routing happens via 
routers connected to the backbone area and to their own non-backbone areas. It 
is the logical and physical structure for the 'OSPF domain' and is attached to 
all nonzero areas in the OSPF domain. Note that in OSPF the term Autonomous 
System Border Router (ASBR) is historic, in the sense that many OSPF domains can 
coexist in the same Internet-visible autonomous system.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">The backbone area is 
responsible for distributing routing information between nonbackbone areas. The 
backbone must be contiguous, but it does not need to be physically contiguous; 
backbone connectivity can be established and maintained through the 
configuration of virtual links.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">All OSPF areas must 
connect to the backbone area. This connection, however, can be through a virtual 
link. For example, assume area 0.0.0.1 has a physical connection to area 
0.0.0.0. Further assume that area 0.0.0.2 has no direct connection to the 
backbone, but this area does have a connection to area 0.0.0.1. Area 0.0.0.2 can 
use a virtual link through the <i>transit area</i> 0.0.0.1 to reach the 
backbone. To be a transit area, an area has to have the transit attribute, so it 
cannot be stubby in any way.</span></font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
<span lang="EN">Stub area</span></span></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">A stub area is an area 
which does not receive <i>external</i> routes except the default route, but does 
receive <i>inter-area</i> routes. This kind of area is useful when, for example, 
all Internet access goes through autonomous system border routers (ASBRs) in 
Area 0.0.0.0, but there are multiple paths to other nonzero areas in the OSPF 
domain.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">All routers in the area 
need to agree they are stub, so that they do not generate types of LSA not 
appropriate to a stub area. The Type 5 LSA for the default route is the only 
external that should enter the area, and none of its routers may generate 
externals.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Stub areas do receive 
inter-area (IA) routes, advertised with Type 3 and Type 4 LSAs. If the stub area 
has more than one ABR, the information on other non-backbone areas allows the 
routers in the stub area to pick the best route to another area.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Stub areas do not have the 
transit attribute and thus cannot be traversed by a virtual link.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Stub areas receive default 
routes as type 3 network summary LSAs.</span></font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
<span lang="EN">Totally stubby area</span></span></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">A <i>totally stubby area</i> 
(TSA), which is a nonstandard but useful extension by Cisco, is similar to a 
stub area, however this area does not allow <i>summary</i> routes in addition to 
the <i>external</i> routes, that is, <i>inter-area</i> (IA) routes are not 
summarized into totally stubby areas. The only way for traffic to get routed 
outside of the area is a default route which is the only Type-3 LSA advertised 
into the area. When there is only one route out of the area, fewer routing 
decisions have to be made by the route processor, which lowers system resource 
utilization.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Occasionally, it is said 
that a TSA can have only one ABR. This is not true. If there are multiple ABRs, 
as might be required for high availability, routers interior to the TSA will 
send non-intra-area traffic to the ABR with the lowest intra-area metric (the 
&quot;closest&quot; ABR).</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">An area can simultaneously 
be not-so-stubby and totally stubby. This is done when the practical place to 
put an ASBR, as, for example, with a newly acquired subsidiary, is on the edge 
of a totally stubby area. In such a case, the ASBR does send externals into the 
totally stubby area, and they are available to OSPF speakers within that area. 
In Cisco's implementation, the external routes can be summarized before 
injecting them into the totally stubby area. In general, the ASBR should not 
advertise default into the TSA-NSSA, although this can work with extremely 
careful design and operation, for the limited special cases in which such an 
advertisement makes sense.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">By declaring the totally 
stubby area as NSSA, no external routes from the backbone, except the default 
route, enter the area being discussed. The externals do reach area 0.0.0.0 via 
the TSA-NSSA, but no routes other than the default route enter the TSA-NSSA. 
Routers in the TSA-NSSA send all traffic to the ABR, except to routes advertised 
by the ASBR.</span></font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
<span lang="EN">Not-so-stubby area</span></span></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">A <i>not-so-stubby area</i> 
(NSSA) is a type of stub area that can import <i>autonomous system</i> (AS) 
external routes and send them to the backbone, but cannot receive AS external 
routes from the backbone or other areas. The NSSA is a non-proprietary extension 
of the existing stub area feature that allows the injection of external routes 
in a limited fashion into the stub area.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Cisco also implements a 
proprietary version of a NSSA called a <i>NSSA totally stubby area</i>. It takes 
on the attributes of a TSA, meaning that type 3 and type 4 summary routes are 
not flooded into this type of area. It is also possible to declare an area both 
totally stubby and not-so-stubby, which means that the area will receive only 
the default route from area 0.0.0.0, but can also contain an autonomous system 
border router (ASBR) that accepts external routing information and injects it 
into the local area, and from the local area into area 0.0.0.0.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Redistribution into an 
NSSA area creates special type of LSA known as TYPE 7, which can exist only in 
an NSSA area. An NSSA ASBR generates this LSA, and an NSSA ABR router translates 
it into type 5 LSA which gets propagated into the OSPF domain.</span></font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN"><font size="3">
Path Preference</font></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">OSPF uses <i>path cost</i> 
as its basic routing metric, which was defined by the standard not to equate to 
any standard value such as speed, so the network designer could pick a metric 
important to the design. In practice, it is determined by the speed (bandwidth) 
of the interface addressing the given route, although that tends to need 
network-specific scaling factors now that links faster than 100 Mbit/s are 
common.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Metrics, however, are only 
directly comparable when of the same type. There are four types of metrics, with 
the most preferred type listed in order below. An intra-area route is always 
preferred to an inter-area route regardless of metric, and so on for the other 
types.</span></font></p>

OSPF router types</font></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">OSPF defines the following 
router types:</span></font></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Area border router (ABR)
  </span></font></li>

  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Backbone router (BR)
  </span></font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">The router types are 
attributes of an OSPF process. A given physical router may have one or more OSPF 
processes. For example, a router that is connected to more than one area, and 
which receives routes from a BGP process connected to another AS, is both an ABR 
and an ASBR.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Each router has a router 
identifier, customarily written in the dotted decimal format (e.g.: 1.2.3.4) of 
an IP address. The way in which the router ID is determined is 
implementation-specific. The router ID, however, does not have to be a valid IP 
address or any IP address present in the routing domain, although it frequently 
will be advertised within the domain for troubleshooting purposes. Do not 
assume, until it is known how it is configured, that the router ID is anything 
more than a 32-bit number (e.g., 255.254.253.252 is legal as a router ID).</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Do not confuse router 
types with <i>designated router (DR)</i>, or <i>backup designated router (BDR)</i>, 
which is an attribute of a router interface.</span></font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
<span lang="EN">Area border router</span></span></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">An ABR is a router that 
connects one or more OSPF areas to the main backbone network. It is considered a 
member of all areas it is connected to. An ABR keeps multiple copies of the 
link-state database in memory, one for each area to which that router is 
connected.</span></font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
<span lang="EN">Autonomous system boundary router</span></span></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">An ASBR is a router that 
is connected to more than one AS and that exchanges routing information with 
routers in other ASs. ASBRs typically also run a non-IGP routing protocol (e.g., 
BGP), or use static routes, or both. An ASBR is used to distribute routes 
received from other ASs throughout its own AS.</span></font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
<span lang="EN">Internal router</span></span></font></h3>

only OSPF neighbor relationships with routers in the same area.</span></font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">
<span lang="EN">Backbone router</span></span></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Backbone Routers: These 
are routers that are part of the OSPF backbone. By definition, this includes all 
area border routers, since those routers pass routing information between areas. 
However, a backbone router may also be a router that connects only to other 
backbone (or area border) routers, and is therefore not part of any area (other 
than Area 0).</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">To summarize: an area 
border router is always a backbone router, but a backbone router is not 
necessarily an area border router.</span></font></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span class="mw-headline"><span lang="EN"><font size="3">
Designated &quot;router&quot;</font></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">A <i>designated router</i> 
(DR) is the router interface elected among all routers on a particular 
multiaccess network segment, generally assumed to be broadcast multiaccess. 
Special techniques, often vendor-dependent, may be needed to support the DR 
function on nonbroadcast multiaccess (NBMA) media. It is usually wise to 
configure the individual virtual circuits of a NBMA subnet as individual 
point-to-point lines; the techniques used are implementation-dependent.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Do not confuse the DR with 
an OSPF router type. A given physical router can have some interfaces that are 
designated, others that are backup designated (BDR), and others that are 
non-designated. If no router is DR or BDR on a given subnet, the BDR is first 
elected, and then a second election is held if there is more than one BDR. The 
router winning the second election becomes DR, or, if there is no other BDR, 
designates itself DR. The DR is elected based on the following default criteria:</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">If the priority setting 
  on a OSPF router is set to 0, that means it can NEVER become a DR or BDR

  BDR takes over, there is another election to see who becomes the replacement 
  BDR. </span></font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">The router sending the 
  Hello packets with the highest priority wins the election. </span></font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">If two or more routers 
  tie with the highest priority setting, the router sending the Hello with the 
  highest RID (Router ID) wins. NOTE: a RID is the highest logical (loopback) IP 
  address configured on a router, if no logical/loopback IP address is set then 
  the Router uses the highest IP address configured on its active interfaces. 
  (e.g. 192.168.0.1 would be higher than 10.1.1.2). </span></font></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">Usually the router with

  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">IF a HIGHER priority 
  OSPF router comes online AFTER the election has taken place, it will not

  <li class="MsoNormal">
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">If the current DR 'goes 
  down' the current BDR becomes the new DR and a new election takes place to 
  find another BDR. If the new DR then 'goes down' and the original DR is now

  </span></font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">DR's exist for the purpose 
of reducing network traffic by providing a source for routing updates, the DR 
maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends the updates to the 
other routers via multicast. All routers in an area will form a slave/master 
relationship with the DR. They will form adjacencies with the DR and BDR only. 
Every time a router sends an update, it sends it to the DR and BDR on the 
multicast address 224.0.0.6. The DR will then send the update out to all other 
routers in the area, to the multicast address 224.0.0.5. This way all the 
routers do not have to constantly update each other, and can rather get all 
their updates from a single source. The use of multicasting further reduces the 
network load. DRs and BDRs are always setup/elected on Broadcast networks 
(Ethernet). DR's can also be elected on NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) 
networks such as Frame Relay or ATM. DRs or BDRs are not elected on 
point-to-point links (such as a point-to-point WAN connection) because the two 
routers on either sides of the link must become fully adjacent and the bandwidth 
between them cannot be further optimized.</span></font></p>

Applications</font></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">OSPF was the first widely 
deployed routing protocol that could converge a network in the low seconds, and 
guarantee loop-free paths. It has a great many features that allow the 
imposition of policies about the propagation of routes that it may be 
appropriate to keep local, for load sharing, and for selective route importing 
more than IS-IS. IS-IS, in contrast, can be tuned for lower overhead in a stable 
network, the sort more common in ISP than enterprise networks. There are some 
historical accidents that made IS-IS the preferred IGP for ISPs, but ISP's today 
may well choose to use the features of the now-efficient implementations of OSPF, 
after first considering the pros and cons of ISIS in service provider 
environments.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">As mentioned, OSPF can 
provide better load-sharing on external links than other IGPs. When the default 
route to an ISP is injected into OSPF from multiple ASBRS as a Type I external 
route and the same external cost specified, other routers will go to the ASBR 
with the least path cost from its location. This can be tuned further by 
adjusting the external cost.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span lang="EN">In contrast, if the 
default route from different ISPs is injected with different external costs, as 
a Type II external route, the lower-cost default becomes the primary exit and 
the higher-cost becomes the backup only.</span></font></p>
