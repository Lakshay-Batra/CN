Virtual private network</span></font></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">A <b>
virtual private network</b> (<b>VPN</b>) is a private communications network 
usually used within a company, or by several different companies or 
organizations, to communicate over a wider network. VPN message traffic can be 
carried over a public networking infrastructure (e.g. the Internet) on top of 
standard protocols, or over a service provider's private network with a defined 
Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service 
provider.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Authentication 
mechanism</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><b><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">VPN</span></b><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial"> 
involves two parts: the protected or &quot;inside&quot; network, which provides physical 
and administrative security to protect the transmission; and a less trustworthy, 
&quot;outside&quot; network or segment (usually through the Internet). Generally, a 
firewall sits between a remote user's workstation or client and the host network 
or server. As the user's client establishes the communication with the firewall, 
the client may pass authentication data to an authentication service inside the 
perimeter. A known trusted person, sometimes only when using trusted devices, 
can be provided with appropriate security privileges to access resources not 
available to general users.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Many 
VPN client programs can be configured to require that all IP traffic must pass 
through the tunnel while the VPN is active, for better security. From the user's 
perspective, this means that while the VPN client is active, all access outside 
their employer's secure network must pass through the same firewall as would be 
the case while physically connected to the office ethernet. This reduces the 
risk that an attacker might gain access to the secured network by attacking the 
employee's laptop: to other computers on the employee's home network, or on the 
public internet, it is as though the machine running the VPN client simply does 
not exist. Such security is important because other computers local to the 
network on which the client computer is operating may be untrusted or partially 
trusted. Even with a home network that is protected from the outside internet by 
a firewall, people who share a home may be simultaneously working for different 
employers over their respective <b>VPN</b> connections from the shared home 
network. Each employer would therefore want to ensure their proprietary data is 
kept secure, even if another computer in the local network gets infected with
malware. And if a travelling employee uses a VPN client from a Wi-Fi access 
point in a public place, such security is even more important. However, the use 
of IPX/SPX is one way users might still be able to access local resources.</span></p>

Secure VPNs</span></b><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial"> (SVPNs) use 
cryptographic tunneling protocols to provide the necessary confidentiality

integrity (preventing message alteration) to achieve the privacy intended.

secure communications over unsecured networks.</span></p>

Tunneling is the transmission of data intended for use only within a private,

routing nodes in the public network are unaware that the transmission is part of 
a private network. Tunneling is generally done by encapsulating the private 
network data and protocol information within the public network transmission 
units so that the private network protocol information appears to the public 
network as data. Tunneling allows the use of the Internet, which is a public 
network, to convey data on behalf of a private network.</span></p>

you know (a login name, a password), something you have (a token, a card key), 
something you are (fingerprint, retinal scan). Weak authentication makes use of

private networks</span></i><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">
<i>(VPNs) </i>are a fairly quixotic subject; there is no single defining 
product, nor even much of a consensus among VPN vendors as to what comprises a 
VPN. Consequently, everyone knows what a VPN is, but establishing a single 
definition can be remarkably difficult. Some definitions are sufficiently broad 
as to enable one to claim that Frame Relay qualifies as a VPN when, in fact, it 
is an overlay network. Although an overlay network secures transmissions through 
a public network, it does so passively via logical separation of the data 
streams.</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial"> </span></h2>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">VPNs provide a more active form of security by 
either encrypting or encapsulating data for transmission through an unsecured 
network. These two types of security—encryption and encapsulation—form the 
foundation of virtual private networking. However, both <i>encryption</i> and <i>
encapsulation</i> are generic terms that describe a function that can be 
performed by a myriad of specific technologies. To add to the confusion, these 
two sets of technologies can be combined in different implementation topologies. 
Thus, VPNs can vary widely from vendor to vendor. </span></p>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">This chapter provides an overview of building 
VPNs using the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), and it explores the possible 
implementation topologies. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
</span></h2>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was 
faced with competing proposals from Microsoft and Cisco Systems for a protocol 
specification that would secure the transmission of IP datagrams through 
uncontrolled and untrusted network domains. Microsoft's proposal was an attempt 
to standardize the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), which it had 
championed. Cisco, too, had a protocol designed to perform a similar function. 
The IETF combined the best elements of each proposal and specified the open 
standard L2TP. </span></p>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The simplest description of L2TP's 
functionality is that it carries the <i>Point-to-Point Protocol</i> (<i>PPP</i>) 
through networks that aren't point-to-point. PPP has become the most popular 
communications protocol for remote access using circuit-switched transmission 
facilities such as POTS lines or ISDN to create a temporary point-to-point 
connection between the calling device and its destination. </span></p>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">L2TP simulates a point-to-point connection by 
encapsulating PPP datagrams for transportation through routed networks or 
internetworks. Upon arrival at their intended destination, the encapsulation is 
removed, and the PPP datagrams are restored to their original format. Thus, a 
point-to-point communications session can be supported through disparate 
networks. This technique is known as <i>tunneling</i>. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Operational Mechanics </span>
</h2>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">In a traditional remote access scenario, a 
remote user (or client) accesses a network by directly connecting a <i>network 
access server</i> <i>(NAS)</i>. Generally, the NAS provides several distinct 
functions: It terminates the point-to-point communications session of the remote 
user, validates the identity of that user, and then serves that user with access 
to the network. Although most remote access technologies bundle these functions 
into a single device, L2TP separates them into two physically separate devices: 
the <i>L2TP Access Server (LAS)</i> and the <i>L2TP Network Server</i> <i>(LNS)</i>.
</span></p>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">As its names imply, the L2TP Access Server 
supports authentication, and ingress. Upon successful authentication, the remote 
user's session is forwarded to the LNS, which lets that user into the network. 
Their separation enables greater flexibility for implementation than other 
remote access technologies. </span></p>

<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The distinction between these two topologies is 
whether the client machine that is using L2TP to access a remote network is 
aware that its connection is being tunneled. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Client-Aware Tunneling
</span></h3>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The first implementation topology is known as 
client-aware tunneling. This name is derived from the remote client initiating 
(hence, being &quot;aware&quot; of) the tunnel. In this scenario, the client establishes a 
logical connection within a physical connection to the LAS. The client remains 
aware of the tunneled connection all the way through to the LNS, and it can even 
determine which of its traffic goes through the tunnel. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Client-Transparent Tunneling
</span></h3>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">Client-transparent tunneling features L2TP 
access concentrators (LACs) distributed geographically close to the remote 
users. Such geographic dispersion is intended to reduce the long-distance 
telephone charges that would otherwise be incurred by remote users dialing into 
a centrally located LAC. </span></p>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The remote users need not support L2TP 
directly; they merely establish a point-to-point communication session with the 
LAC using PPP. Ostensibly, the user will be encapsulating IP datagrams in PPP 
frames. The LAC exchanges PPP messages with the remote user and establishes an 
L2TP tunnel with the LNS through which the remote user's PPP messages are 
passed. </span></p>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The LNS is the remote user's gateway to its 
home network. It is the terminus of the tunnel; it strips off all L2TP 
encapsulation and serves up network access for the remote user. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Adding More Security </span>
</h2>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">As useful as L2TP is, it is important to 
recognize that it is not a panacea. It enables flexibility in delivering remote 
access, but it does not afford a high degree of security for data in transit. 
This is due in large part to the relatively nonsecure nature of PPP. In 
fairness, PPP was designed explicitly for point-to-point communications, so 
securing the connection should not have been a high priority. </span></p>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">An additional cause for concern stems from the 
fact that L2TP's tunnels are not cryptographic. Their data payloads are 
transmitted in the clear, wrapped only by L2TP and PPP framing. However, 
additional security may be afforded by implementing the IPSec protocols in 
conjunction with L2TP. The IPSec protocols support strong authentication 
technologies as well as encryption. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Summary </span></h2>
<p class="pb1body1" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">VPNs offer a compelling vision of connectivity 
through foreign networks at greatly reduced operating costs. However, the 
reduced costs are accompanied by increased risk. L2TP offers an open standard 
approach for supporting a remote access VPN. When augmented by IPSec protocols, 
L2TP enables the realization of the promise of a VPN: an open standard 
technology for securing remote access in a virtually private network. </span>
