<p><b><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Fiber-Distributed Data Interface</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> (<b>FDDI</b>) 
provides a standard for data transmission in a local area network that can 
extend in range up to 200 kilometers (124 miles). The FDDI protocol uses as its 
basis the token ring protocol. In addition to covering large geographical areas, 
FDDI local area networks can support thousands of users. As a standard 
underlying medium it uses optical fiber (though it can use copper cable, in 
which case one can refer to CDDI). FDDI uses a dual-attached, counter-rotating 
token-ring topology.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">FDDI, as a product of 
American National Standards Institute X3-T9, conforms to the open system 
interconnect (OSI) model of functional layering of LANs using other protocols. 
FDDI-II, a version of FDDI, adds the capability to add circuit-switched service 
to the network so that it can also handle voice and video signals. Work has 
started to connect FDDI networks to the developing Synchronous Optical Network 
SONET.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">An FDDI network contains two 
token rings, one for possible backup in case the primary ring fails. The primary 
ring offers up to 100 Mbit/s capacity. When a network has no requirement for the 
secondary ring to do backup, it can also carry data, extending capacity to 200 
Mbit/s. The single ring can extend the maximum distance; a dual ring can extend 
100 km (62 miles). FDDI has a larger maximum-frame size than standard 100 Mbit/s 
Ethernet, allowing better throughput.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Designers normally construct 
FDDI rings in the form of a &quot;dual ring of trees&quot; (see network topology). A small 
number of devices (typically infrastructure devices such as routers and 
concentrators rather than host computers) connect to both rings - hence the term 
&quot;dual-attached&quot;. Host computers then connect as single-attached devices to the 
routers or concentrators. The dual ring in its most degenerate form simply 
collapses into a single device. Typically, a computer-room contains the whole 
dual ring, although some implementations have deployed FDDI as a Metropolitan 
area network.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">FDDI requires this network 
topology because the dual ring actually passes through each connected device and 
requires each such device to remain continuously operational (the standard 
actually allows for optical bypasses, but network engineers consider these 
unreliable and error-prone). Devices such as workstations and minicomputers that 
may not come under the control of the network managers are not suitable for 
connection to the dual ring.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">As an alternative to using a 
dual-attached connection, a workstation can obtain the same degree of resilience 
through a dual-homed connection made simultaneously to two separate devices in 
the same FDDI ring. One of the connections becomes active while the other one is 
automatically blocked. If the first connection fails, the backup link takes over 
with no perceptible delay.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Due to their speed, cost and 
ubiquity, fast Ethernet and (since 1998) Gigabit Ethernet has largely made FDDI 
redundant.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The <em>Fiber Distributed Data Interface 
(FDDI)</em> specifies a 100-Mbps token-passing, dual-ring LAN using fiber-optic 
cable. FDDI is frequently used as high-speed backbone technology because of its 
support for high bandwidth and greater distances than copper. It should be noted 
that relatively recently, a related copper specification, called Copper 
Distributed Data Interface (CDDI), has emerged to provide 100-Mbps service over 
copper. CDDI is the implementation <br>
of FDDI protocols over twisted-pair copper wire. This chapter focuses mainly on 
FDDI specifications and operations, but it also provides a high-level overview 
of CDDI.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="1020552"><font face="Arial">FDDI uses dual-ring 
architecture with traffic on each ring flowing in opposite directions (called 
counter-rotating). The dual rings consist of a primary and a secondary ring. 
During normal operation, the primary ring is used for data transmission, and the 
secondary ring remains idle. As will be discussed in detail later in this 
chapter, the primary purpose of the dual rings is to provide superior 
reliability and robustness. Figure 8-1 shows the counter-rotating primary and 
secondary FDDI rings. </font></p>

<h3 align="justify"></a><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="xtocid3">Standards</a></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">FDDI was developed by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) X3T9.5 </font><a name="1020561">
<font face="Arial">standards committee in the mid-1980s. At the time, high-speed 
engineering workstations were beginning to tax the bandwidth of existing 
local-area networks (LANs) based on Ethernet and Token Ring. A new LAN media was 
needed that could easily support these workstations and their new distributed 
applications. At the same time, network reliability had become an increasingly 
important issue as system managers migrated mission-critical applications from 
large computers to networks. FDDI was developed to fill these needs. After 
completing the FDDI specification, ANSI submitted FDDI to the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO), which created an international version 
of FDDI that is completely compatible with the ANSI standard version.</font></p>
<h2 align="justify"></a><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="xtocid4">FDDI 
Transmission Media</a></font></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><a name="1020563">FDDI uses optical fiber 
as the primary transmission medium, but it also can run over copper cabling. As 
mentioned earlie</a><a name="1020565">r, FDDI over copper is referred to as <em>
Copper-Distributed Data Interface (CDDI)</em></a></font><a name="1020566"><font face="Arial">. 
Optical fiber has several advantages over copper media. In particular, security, 
reliability, and performance all are enhanced with optical fiber media because 
fiber does not emit electrical signals. A physical medium that does emit 
electrical signals (copper) can be tapped and therefore would permit 
unauthorized access to the data that is transiting the medium. In addition, 
fiber is immune to electrical interference from radio frequency interference (RFI) 
and electromagnetic interference (EMI). Fiber historically has supported much 
higher bandwidth (throughput potential) than copper, although recent 
technological advances have made copper capable of transmitting at 100 Mbps. 
Finally, FDDI allows 2 km between stations using multimode fiber, and even 
longer distances using a single mode.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></a><a name="1020567"><font face="Arial">FDDI defines two 
types of optical fiber: single-mode and multimode. A <em>mode</em> is a ray of 
light that enters the fiber at a particular angle. <em>Multimode</em> fiber uses 
LED as the light-generating device, while <em>single-mode</em> fiber generally 
uses lasers. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Multimode fiber allows multiple modes of 
light to propagate through the fiber. Because these modes of light enter the 
fiber at different angles, they will arrive at the end of the fiber at different 
times. This characteristic is known as </font></a><a name="1020570">
<font face="Arial"><em>modal dispersion</em>. Modal dispersion limits the 
bandwidth and distances that can be accomplished using multimode fibers. For 
this reason, multimode fiber is generally used for connectivity within a 
building or a relatively geographically contained environment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Single-mode fiber allows only one mode of 
light to propagate through the fiber. Because only a single mode of light is 
used, modal dispersion is not present with single-mode fiber. Therefore, 
single-mode fiber is capable of delivering considerably higher performance 
connectivity over much larger distances, which is why it generally is used for 
connectivity between buildings and within environments that are more 
geographically dispersed. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Figure 8-2 depicts single-mode fiber using 
a laser light source and multimode fiber using a light emitting diode (LED) 
light source.</font></p>

Specifications</a></font></h2>
<p align="justify"><a name="1020578"><font face="Arial">FDDI specifies the 
physical and media-access portions of the OSI reference model. FDDI is not 
actually a single specification, but it is a collection of four separate 
specifications, each with a specific function. Combined, these specifications 
have the capability to provide high-speed connectivity between upper-layer 
protocols such as TCP/IP and IPX, and media such as fiber-optic cabling. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">FDDI's four specifications are the Media 
Access Control (MAC), Physical Layer <br>
Protocol (PHY), Physical-Medium Dependent (PMD), and Station Management (SMT) 
specifications. The <em>MAC</em> specification defines how the medium is 
accessed, including </font></a><font face="Arial"><a name="1020581">frame 
format, token handling, addressing, algorithms for calculating cyclic redundancy 
check (CRC) value, and error-recovery mechanisms. The <em>PHY</em> specification 
defines data encoding/decoding procedures, clocking requirements, and framing, 
among other functions. The </a><a name="1020582"><em>PMD</em> specification 
defines the characteristics of the transmission medium, including fiber-optic 
links, power levels, bit-error rates, optical components, and connectors. The
</a></font><a name="1020583"><font face="Arial"><em>SMT</em> specification 
defines FDDI station configuration, ring configuration, and ring control 
features, including station insertion and removal, initialization, fault 
isolation and recovery, scheduling, and statistics collection.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">FDDI is similar to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet and 
IEEE 802.5 Token Ring in its relationship with the OSI model. Its primary 
purpose is to provide connectivity between upper OSI layers of common protocols 
and the media used to connect network devices. Figure 8-3 illustrates the four 
FDDI specifications and their relationship to each other and to the IEEE-defined 
Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer. The LLC sublayer is a component of Layer 2, 
the MAC layer, of the OSI reference model.</font></p>

Station-Attachment Types</a></font></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">One of the unique characteristics of FDDI 
is that multiple ways actually exist by which to connect FDDI devices. FDDI 
defines four types of devices: single-attachment station (SAS), dual-attachment 
station (DAS), single-attached concentrator (SAC), and dual-attached 
concentrator (DAC).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="1020593"><font face="Arial">An SAS attaches to only 
one ring (the primary) through a concentrator. One of the primary advantages of 
connecting devices with SAS attachments is that the devices will not have any 
effect on the FDDI ring if they are disconnected or powered off. Concentrators 
will be covered in more detail in the following discussion.</font></p>
<p align="justify"></a><a name="1020595"><font face="Arial">Each FDDI DAS has 
two ports, designated A and B. These ports connect the DAS to the dual FDDI 
ring. Therefore, each port provides a connection for both the primary and the 
secondary rings. As you will see in the next section, devices using DAS 
connections will affect the rings if they are disconnected or powered off. 
Figure 8-4 shows FDDI DAS A and B ports with attachments to the primary and 
secondary rings.</font></p>

that the failure or power-down of any SAS does not bring down the ring. This is 
particularly useful when PCs, or similar devices that are frequently powered on 
and off, connect to the ring. Figure 8-5 shows the ring attachments of an FDDI 
SAS, DAS, and concentrator.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><a name="1020611"><font face="Arial">FDDI provides a number

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><a name="1020614">FDDI's primary 
fault-tolerant feature is the <em>dual ring</em>. If a station on the dual ring 
fails or is powered down, or if the cable is damaged, the dual ring is 
automatically wrapped (doubled back onto itself) into a single ring. When the 
ring is wrapped, the dual-ring topology </a></font><a name="1020616">
<font face="Arial">becomes a single-ring topology. Data continues to be 
transmitted on the FDDI ring without performance impact during the wrap 
condition. Figure 8-6 and Figure 8-7 illustrate the effect of a ring wrapping in 
FDDI.</font></p>

Figure 8-6, devices on either side of the failed (or powered-down) station wrap, 
forming a single ring. Network operation continues for the remaining stations on 
the ring. When a cable failure occurs, as shown in Figure 8-7, devices on either 
side of the cable fault wrap. Network operation continues for all stations.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It should be noted that FDDI truly 
provides fault tolerance against a single failure only. </font></a>
<font face="Arial"><a name="1020628">When two or more failures occur, the FDDI 
ring segments into two or more independent </a></font><a name="1020629">
<font face="Arial">rings that are incapable of communicating with each other.

<h3 align="justify"></a><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="xtocid9">Optical 
Bypass Switch</a></font></h3>
<p align="justify"><a name="1020631"><font face="Arial">An <em>optical bypass 
switch</em> provides continuous dual-ring operation if a device on the dual ring 
fails. This is used both to prevent ring segmentation and to eliminate failed 
stations from the ring. The optical bypass switch performs this function using 
optical mirrors that pass light from the ring directly to the DAS device during 
normal operation. If a failure of the DAS device occurs, such as a power-off, 
the optical bypass switch will pass the light through itself by using internal 
mirrors and thereby will maintain the ring's integrity. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The benefit of this capability is that the 
ring will not enter a wrapped condition in case of a device failure. Figure 8-8 
shows the functionality of an optical bypass switch in an FDDI network. When 
using the OB, you will notice a tremendous digression of your network as the 
packets are sent through the OB unit.</font></p>
