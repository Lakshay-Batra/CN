  <span style="font-family:Arial">The sequential interrogation of devices for 
  various purposes, such as avoiding contention, determining operational status,

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">Polling</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
in computer science, refers to actively sampling the status of an external 
device by a client program as a synchronous activity. Polling is most often used 
in terms of I/O, and is also referred to as <b>polled I/O</b>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Polled I/O is a 
system by which an operating system (OS) waits and monitors a device until the 
device is ready to read. In early computer systems, when a program would want to 
read a key from the keyboard, it would constantly poll the keyboard status port 
until a key was available; due to lack of multiple processes such computers 
could not do other operations while waiting for the keyboard. The solution and 
alternative to this approach is for the device controller to generate an 
interrupt when the device was ready to transfer data. The CPU handles this 
interrupt and the OS knows to fetch the data from the relevant device registers. 
This solution is called interrupt-driven I/O.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Another example of 
polling can be found in many online chat solutions where a server must queue 
messages and wait to be asked by a client. This is the most common mechanism for 
chat utilizing the </span><span style="font-family:

technique.</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">(1)</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
Polling is a CAM. In a master/slave scenario, the master queries each slave 
device in turn as to whether it has any data to transmit. If the slave answers
<i>yes</i> then the device is permitted to transmit its data. If the slave 
answers <i>no</i> then the master moves on and <i>polls</i> the next slave 
device. The process is repeated continuously.</span></p>

Short for <b><i>c</i></b><i>hannel <b>a</b>ccess <b>m</b>ethod</i>, a protocol 
for how data is transmitted in the bottom two layers of the OSI model. CAMs 
describe how networking systems put data on the network media, how low-level 
errors are dealt with, and how the network polices itself. Polling, contention 
and token passing are three examples of CAMs. </span></p>

is, two or more nodes may try to send messages across the network 
simultaneously. The contention protocol defines what happens when this occurs. 
The most widely used contention protocol is CSMA/CD, used by Ethernet. </span>
