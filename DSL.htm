<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) 
is a technology for bringing high-bandwidth information to homes and small 
businesses over ordinary copper telephone lines. xDSL refers to different 
variations of DSL, such as ADSL, HDSL, and RADSL. Assuming your home or small 
business is close enough to a telephone company central office that offers DSL 
service, you may be able to receive data at rates up to 6.1 megabits (millions 
of bits) per second (of a theoretical 8.448 megabits per second), enabling 
continuous transmission of motion video, audio, and even 3-D effects. More 
typically, individual connections will provide from 1.544 Mbps to 512 Kbps 
downstream and about 128 Kbps upstream. A DSL line can carry both data and voice 
signals and the data part of the line is continuously connected. DSL 
installations began in 1998 and will continue at a greatly increased pace 
through the next decade in a number of communities in the U.S. and elsewhere. 
Compaq, Intel, and Microsoft working with telephone companies have developed a 
standard and easier-to-install form of ADSL called G.lite that is accelerating 
deployment. DSL is expected to replace ISDN in many areas and to compete with 
the cable modem in bringing multimedia and 3-D to homes and small businesses.
</span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">How It Works</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Traditional phone service (sometimes 
called POTS for &quot;plain old telephone service&quot;) connects your home or small 
business to a telephone company office over copper wires that are wound around 
each other and called twisted pair. Traditional phone service was created to let 
you exchange voice information with other phone users and the type of signal 
used for this kind of transmission is called an analog signal. An input device 
such as a phone set takes an acoustic signal (which is a natural analog signal) 
and converts it into an electrical equivalent in terms of volume (signal 
amplitude) and pitch (frequency of wave change). Since the telephone company's 
signaling is already set up for this analog wave transmission, it's easier for 
it to use that as the way to get information back and forth between your 
telephone and the telephone company. That's why your computer has to have a 
modem - so that it can demodulate the analog signal and turn its values into the 
string of 0 and 1 value that is called digital information. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Because analog transmission 
only uses a small portion of the available amount of information that could be 
transmitted over copper wires, the maximum amount of data that you can receive 
using ordinary modems is about 56 Kbps (thousands of bits per second). (With 
ISDN, which one might think of as a limited precursor to DSL, you can receive up 
to 128 Kbps.) The ability of your computer to receive information is constrained 
by the fact that the telephone company filters information that arrives as 
digital data, puts it into analog form for your telephone line, and requires 
your modem to change it back into digital. In other words, the analog 
transmission between your home or business and the phone company is a bandwidth 
bottleneck. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Digital Subscriber Line is a 
technology that assumes digital data does not require change into analog form 
and back. Digital data is transmitted to your computer directly as digital data 
and this allows the phone company to use a much wider bandwidth for transmitting 
it to you. Meanwhile, if you choose, the signal can be separated so that some of 
the bandwidth is used to transmit an analog signal so that you can use your 
telephone and computer on the same line and at the same time. </span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Splitter-based 
vs. Splitter less DSL</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Most DSL technologies require that a 
signal splitter be installed at a home or business, requiring the expense of a 
phone company visit and installation. However, it is possible to manage the 
splitting remotely from the central office. This is known as splitterless DSL, 
&quot;DSL Lite,&quot; G.Lite, or Universal ADSL and has recently been made a standard.
</span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Modulation 
Technologies</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Several modulation technologies are 
used by various kinds of DSL, although these are being standardized by the 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Different DSL modem makers are 
using either Discrete Multitone Technology (DMT) or Carrierless Amplitude 
Modulation (CAP). A third technology, known as Multiple Virtual Line (MVLnother 
possibility. </span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">Factors 
Affecting the Experienced Data Rate</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">DSL modems follow the data rate 
multiples established by North American and European standards. In general, the 
maximum range for DSL without a repeater is 5.5 km (18,000 feet). As distance 
decreases toward the telephone company office, the data rate increases. Another 
factor is the gauge of the copper wire. The heavier 24 gauge wire carries the 
same data rate farther than 26 gauge wire. If you live beyond the 5.5 kilometer 
range, you may still be able to have DSL if your phone company has extended the 
local loop with optical fiber cable. </span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><a name="dslam">
<span style="font-family:Arial;color:black;font-weight:normal">The Digital 
Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)</span></a></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial;color:black">To interconnect multiple DSL users 
to a high-speed backbone network, the telephone company uses a Digital 
Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM). Typically, the DSLAM connects to an 
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network that can aggregate data transmission at 
gigabit data rates. At the other end of each transmission, a DSLAM demultiplexes 
the signals and forwards them to appropriate individual DSL connections. </span>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Who's 
Offering It When</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">DSL is now offered in most parts 
of the United States, in the UK, and elsewhere. The availability of DSL service 
depends on whether a local company has made the necessary investment in 
equipment and line reconditioning and on your own proximity to the telephone 
company. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Companies offering DSL service in various 
parts of the United States include BellSouth, Covad, Primary Network, Qwest, SBC 
Communications, and Verizon. In general, a faster and more expensive is offered 
for business users. </font></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Types of DSL</span></h4>
<h5 align="justify">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-family:Arial; color:black"><font size="3">ADSL</font></span></h5>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The variation called ADSL 
(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is the form of DSL that will become most 
familiar to home and small business users. ADSL is called &quot;asymmetric&quot; because 
most of its two-way or
duplex bandwidth is devoted to the downstream direction, sending data to the 
user. Only a small portion of bandwidth is available for upstream or 
user-interaction messages. However, most Internet and especially graphics- or 
multi-media intensive Web data need lots of downstream bandwidth, but user 
requests and responses are small and require little upstream bandwidth. Using 
ADSL, up to 6.1 megabits per second of data can be sent downstream and up to 640 
Kbps upstream. The high downstream bandwidth means that your telephone line will 
be able to bring motion video, audio, and 3-D images to your computer or 
hooked-in TV set. In addition, a small portion of the downstream bandwidth can 
be devoted to voice rather data, and you can hold phone conversations without 
requiring a separate line. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Unlike a similar service over your cable 
TV line, using ADSL, you won't be competing for bandwidth with neighbors in your 
area. In many cases, your existing telephone lines will work with ADSL. In some 
areas, they may need upgrading. </font></p>
<h5 align="justify"><a name="cdsl">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal">
<font size="3">CDSL</font></span></a></h5>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">CDSL (Consumer DSL) is a version 
of DSL, trademarked by Rockwell Corp., that is somewhat slower than ADSL (1 Mbps 
downstream, probably less upstream) and has the advantage that a &quot;splitter&quot; does 
not need to be installed at the user's end. Rockwell no longer provides 
information about CSDL at its Web site and does not appear to be marketing it.
</span></p>
<h5 align="justify"><a name="dsllite">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: normal">
<font size="3">G.Lite or DSL Lite</font></span></a></h5>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
G.lite (also known as DSL Lite, splitterless ADSL, and Universal ADSL) is 
essentially a slower ADSL that doesn't require splitting of the line at the user 
end but manages to split it for the user remotely at the telephone company. This 
saves the cost of what the phone companies call &quot;the truck roll.&quot; G.Lite, 
officially ITU-T standard G-992.2, provides a data rate from 1.544 Mbps to 6 
Mpbs downstream and from 128 Kbps to 384 Kbps upstream. G.Lite is expected to 
become the most widely installed form of DSL. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">HDSL (High bit-rate Digital 
Subscriber Line), one of the earliest forms of DSL, is used for wideband digital 
transmission within a corporate site and between the telephone company and a 
customer. The main characteristic of HDSL is that it is symmetrical: an equal 
amount of bandwidth is available in both directions. HDSL can carry as much on a 
single wire of twisted-pair cable as can be carried on a T1 line (up to 1.544 
Mbps) in North America or an E1 line (up to 2.048 Mbps) in Europe over a 
somewhat longer range and is considered an alternative to a T1 or E1 connection.

640 Kbps to 2.2 Mbps downstream and from 272 Kbps to 1.088 Mbps upstream over an 
existing line. </span></p>
