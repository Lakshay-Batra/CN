<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Short for <b><i>S</i></b><i>ynchronous
<b>O</b>ptical <b>Net</b>work,</i> a standard for connecting fiber-optic 
transmission systems. SONET was proposed by Bellcore in the middle 1980s and is 
now an ANSI standard. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">SONET defines interface standards at the 
physical layer of the OSI seven-layer model. The standard defines a hierarchy of 
interface rates that allow data streams at different rates to be multiplexed. 
SONET establishes Optical Carrier (OC) levels from 51.8 Mbps (OC-1) to 9.95 Gbps 
(OC-192). Prior rate standards used by different countries specified rates that 
were not compatible for multiplexing. With the implementation of SONET, 
communication carriers throughout the world can interconnect their existing 
digital carrier and fiber optic systems. </font></p>
<p nd="3" align="justify"><font face="Arial">The international equivalent of 
SONET, standardized by the ITU, is called <i>SDH</i>. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family: Arial">The 
Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET) standard for fiber optic networks was 
developed in the mid-1980s. It remains in widespread use today. In a nutshell, 
SONET allows multiple technologies and vendor products to interoperate by 
defining standard physical network interfaces.</span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">Applications</font></span></h4>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">SONET was originally 
designed for the public telephone network. In the early 1980's, the forced 
breakup of AT&amp;T in the United States created numerous regional telephone 
companies, and these companies quickly encountered difficulties in networking 
with each other. Fiber optic cabling already prevailed for long distance voice 
traffic transmissions, but the existing networks proved unnecessarily expensive 
to build and difficult to extend for so-called <i>long haul</i> data and/or 
video traffic. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) successfully devised SONET as the new standard for 
these applications. Like Ethernet, SONET provides a &quot;layer 1&quot; or <i>interface 
layer</i> technology (also termed <i>physical layer</i> in the OSI model). As 
such, SONET acts a carrier of multiple higher-level application protocols. For 
example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets can be configured to flow over SONET.
</span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">Technology</font></span></h4>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">SONET commonly transmits 
data at speeds between 155 megabits per second (Mbps) and 2.5 gigabits per 
second (Gbps). To build these high-bandwidth data streams, SONET <i>multiplexes</i> 
together channels having bandwidth as low as 64 kilobits per second (Kpbs) into
<i>data frames</i> sent at fixed intervals. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Compared to Ethernet cabling 
that spans distances up to100 meters (328 feet), SONET fiber typically runs much 
further. Even <i>short reach</i> links span up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles); <i>
intermediate</i> and <i>long reach</i> links cover dozens of kilometers.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;<b><font size="3">Rings</font></b></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">One of SONET's most 
interesting characteristics is its support for a <i>ring topology</i>. Figure 1 
illustrates the concept of a SONET ring. Normally, one piece of fiber -- the <i>
working ring</i> -- handles all data traffic, but a second piece of fiber -- the
<i>protection ring</i> remains on standby. Should the working ring fail, SONET 
includes the capability to automatically detect the failure and transfer control 
to the protection ring in a very short period of time... often in a fraction of 
a second. For this reason, SONET can be described as a <i>self-healing</i> 
network </span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Rings normally will help 
SONET service to reach the &quot;five nines&quot; availability level. However, the 
usefulness of rings also depends on their physical location. Figure 2 shows two 
instances of SONET ring topology. In (2a), the cables take distinctly different 
routes to reach the same destination. Geographically speaking, one path turns 
north first and then east, the other first turns east. Being physically 
separated, the likelihood of an excavation or natural disaster breaking both 
cables lessens dramatically. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">In (2b), however, the cables 
follow essentially the same route. Imagine in this case two strands of fiber set 
only a few feet apart from each other... possibly even in the same trench! The 
likelihood of one problem disabling both fiber strands increases dramatically, 
effectively defeating the advantage of SONET rings. Note that SONET does not 
require rings: many SONET networks have been deployed in single-strand <i>linear</i> 
architectures. </span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The term <i>OAM&amp;P</i> often 
appears in conjunction with optical network technologies like SONET (and ATM). 
OAM&amp;P -- Operations, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning -- refers to 
the support built into the technology for ease of network management. In the 
case of SONET, a significant number of bytes inside the data frame have been 
reserved for this &quot;management overhead.&quot; At the expense of some bandwidth, 
problems can be more quickly detected, isolated, and repaired. </span></p>
<h4 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">The Future 
of SONET</font></span></h4>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Because SONET can carry very 
large amounts of traffic, it would seem on the surface to be an ideal technology 
for future voice and data broadband networks. SONET competes with several other 
viable technologies including ATM and Gigabit Ethernet for this role. </span>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Other rates (OC-9, OC-18, OC-24, OC-36, 
OC-96) are referenced in some of the standards documents but were never widely 
implemented. It is possible other higher rates (e.g. OC-3072) may be defined in 
in the future. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The &quot;line rate&quot; refers to the raw bit rate 
carried over the optical fiber. A portion of the bits transferred over the line 
are designated as &quot;overhead&quot;. The overhead carries information that provides OAM&amp;P 
(Operations, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning) capabilities such as 
framing, multiplexing, status, trace, and performance monitoring. The &quot;line 
rate&quot; minus the &quot;overhead rate&quot; yields the &quot;payload rate&quot; which is the bandwidth 
available for transferring user data such as packets or ATM cells. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The SONET/SDH level designations sometimes 
include a &quot;c&quot; suffix (such as &quot;OC-48c&quot;). The &quot;c&quot; suffix indicates a 
&quot;concatenated&quot; or &quot;clear&quot; channel. This implies that the entire payload rate is 
available as a single channel of communications (i.e. the entire payload rate 
may be used by a single flow of cells or packets). The opposite of concatenated 
or clear channel is &quot;channelized&quot;. In a channelized link the payload rate is 
subdivided into multiple fixed rate channels. For example, the payload of an 
OC-48 link may be subdivided into four OC-12 channels. In this case the data 
rate of a single cell or packet flow is limited by the bandwidth of an 
individual channel. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial">Q. 
What is the difference between SONET and SDH? </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. To begin with there is no STS-1. &nbsp;The 
first level in the SDH hierarchy is STM-1 (Synchronous Transport Mode 1) is has 
a line rate of 155.52 Mb/s. &nbsp;This is equivalent to SONET's STS-3c. Then would 
come STM-4 at 622.08 Mb/s and STM-16 at 2488.32 Mb/s. &nbsp;The other difference is 
in the overhead bytes which are defined slightly differently for SDH. &nbsp;A common 
misconception is that STM-Ns are formed by multiplexing STM-1s. &nbsp;STM-1s, STM-4s 
and STM-16s that terminate on a network node are broken down to recover the VCs 
which they contain. &nbsp;The outbound STM-Ns are then reconstructed with new 
overheads. &nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. What is hair pinning, and why would 
I want to use it? </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. Hair pinning is bringing traffic in on 
a tributary and instead of putting it on the high speed OC-N line you direct it 
out another low speed tributary port. &nbsp;You might want to do this if you had 
interfaces to two IXCs on different nodes. &nbsp;If one of your IXCs went down you 
could hair pin the other to pick the traffic, assuming the spare capacity 
existed on the tributary.Hairpin cross-connections allow local drop of signals, 
ring extensions supported by a ring host node, and allow passing traffic between 
two ring interfaces on a single host node. In this case, no high speed channel 
is involved and the cross-connections are entirely within the interfaces. &nbsp;
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. Doesn't a &nbsp;2 fiber bi-directional 
line switched ring waste 1/2 the line rate bandwidth? </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. No. &nbsp;It can be shown that in all cases 
the aggregate bandwidth on a 2 fiber BDLSR is no less than the aggregate 
bandwidth on a path switched ring. &nbsp;In some cases that exemplify an inter-office 
transport ring it can actually be shown that the aggregate bandwidth of a 2 
fiber BDLSR can be larger than that of a path switched ring (proof left to 
student). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. What is the difference between TSA 
and TSI?</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. Time Slot Assignment (TSA) allows for 
flexible assignment for add-dropped signals but not for through path signals. 
&nbsp;Once a signal is multiplexed onto a time slot it stays in that time slot until 
it is dropped. &nbsp;Time Slot Interchange is more flexible in that it allows a 
signal passing through a node to be &nbsp;placed in another time slot if desired. 
&nbsp;Equipment that provides neither TSA or TSI is said to be hard wired. &nbsp; This 
pass-through grooming, which is not supported by systems limited to time-slot 
assignment (TSA), allows in-transit bandwidth rearrangements for maximum 
facility utilization. This grooming is most useful for networks with intersite 
routing (for example,interoffice or private networks) and networks with 
significant churn (service removal as well as new service installation </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. What are some timing rules of thumb?
</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. 1. A node can only receive the 
synchronization referencesignal from another node that contains a clock 
ofequivalent or superior quality (Stratum level). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">2. The facilities with the greatest 
availability (absence of outages) should be selected forsynchronization 
facilities. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">3. Where possible, all primary and 
secondary synchronization facilities should be diverse, and synchronization 
facilities within the same cable should be minimized. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">4. The total number of nodes in series 
from the stratum 1 source should be minimized. For example, the primary 
synchronization network would ideally look like a star configuration with the 
stratum 1 source at the center. The nodes connected to the star would branch out 
in decreasing stratum level from the center </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">5. No timing loops may be formed in any 
combination of primary </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. What are some advantages of timing 
from an OC-N line? </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. OC-N timing distribution has several 
potential advantages. It preserves transport bandwidth for customer services and 
guarantees a high-quality timing signal. Also, as the network architecture 
evolves to replace DSX interconnects with SONET interconnects and direct OC-N 
interfaces, OC-N distribution becomes more efficient than multiplexing DS1 
references into an access facility in the CO. A previous drawback to using OC-N 
timing distribution was that network timing failures could not be communicated 
to downstream clocks via DS1 AIS, since the DS1 signal does not pass over the OC-N 
interface. A standard SONET synchronization messaging scheme to convey 
synchronization failures is in place. With this option, clock stratum levels can 
be passed from NE to NE, allowing downstream clocks to switch timing references 
without creating timing loops, if a network synchronization failure occurs. If a 
quality timing reference is no longer available, the NE sends AIS over the DS1 
interface. If the local OC-N lines fail, the NE outputs AIS on the DS1 output or 
an upstream NE enters holdover. &nbsp;Although an ideal source of timing, OC-N timing 
distribution, via a DS1 timing output, cannot be used to provide timing in all 
applications. In cases where the local equipment is not provided with an 
external timing reference input, or in some private networks where the timing is 
to be distributed from another private network location, timing may be 
distributed via traffic-carrying DS1s. In these applications, a stable DS1 
timing source can be achieved by ensuring that all elements in the SONET network 
are directly traceable to a single master clock via line timing. Note: 
Synchronous operation via line timing eliminates the generation of VT pointer 
adjustments, thus maintaining the phase stability needed for a high-quality DS1 
timing reference. Cross-connecting at the STS-1 level also eliminates the VT 
pointer adjustments. It is recommended that, where possible, the DS1 sources 
(switch, PBX, or other equipment) be traceable to the same timing source used to 
time the SONET NE. Multiplexed DS1 reference transport is also consistent with 
current planning and administration methods (but you better know exactly what is 
happening to that multiplexed DS1) </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. What is the advantage of using the 
DS1 timing output instead of a multiplexed DS1 as the timing reference? </font>
</b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. &nbsp;The DS1 timing output is derived from 
the optical linerate and is superior because: The DS1 is virtually jitter-free. 
Synchronization messages guarantee the traceability of the timing. 
Administration of traffic DS1s for timing is eliminated </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. Can a DS1 carried over SONET ever be 
used as a timing reference? </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. &nbsp;Yes. In many applications there is no 
other choice. Most switch remotes, for instance, obtain their timing from a 
specific DS1 signal generated by their host switch; so these remotes must 
line/loop time from the DS1 signal. In addition, DLC equipment, channel banks, 
and PBXs will not likely have external references and may be allowed to 
line/loop time from a DS1 carried over SONET. Five years ago all the literature 
however answered no to this question. &nbsp;See next question. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. Question: Are there any specific 
concerns when using a DS1 carried over SONET to time equipment such as a switch 
remote or DLC? </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. Yes. The major concern is to make sure 
all the equipment is synchronous to each other to prevent pointer adjustments. 
For example should you have an OC-N that goes through multiple carries, a LEC 
and IXC for example, and one of clock is a stratum 1 while the other is being 
timed from some stratum 3 holdover source, you will have pointer adjustments 
that will translate into DS1 timing jitter. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. How many SONET NE's can I chain 
together in an add/drop configuration before the timing becomes degraded? </font>
</b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. The Stratum level traceability of the 
nth node in an add/drop chain is the same as that in the first node. Also, while 
timing jitter will theoretically increase as the number of nodes is increased, 
the high quality timing recovery and filtering should allows add/drop chains to 
be extended to any practical network limit without detectable increases in 
jitter levels. In practice, the only effects on timing at the nth node will 
occur whenever high-speed protectionswitches occur in any of the previous n-1 
nodes. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Q. Why are there more issues related to 
timing with SONET equipment than there is with asynchronous equipment? </font>
</b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A. SONET equipment was designed to work 
ideally in a synchronous network. When the network is not synchronous, 
mechanisms such as pointer processing and bit-stuffing must be used and 
jitter/wander increases.</font></p>
