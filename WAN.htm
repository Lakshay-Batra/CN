<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">WAN</span> is a data 
communications network that covers a relatively broad geographic area and that 
often uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as 
telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three 
layers of the OSI reference model: the physical layer, the data link layer, and 
the network layer. Figure 3-1 illustrates the relationship between the common 
WAN technologies and the OSI model. </font></p>

<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">A
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">point-to-point link</span> 
provides a single, pre-established WAN communications path from the customer 
premises through a carrier network, such as a telephone company, to a remote 
network. Point-to-point lines are usually leased from a carrier and thus are 
often called leased lines. For a point-to-point line, the carrier allocates 
pairs of wire and facility hardware to your line only. These circuits are 
generally priced based on bandwidth required and distance between the two 
connected points. Point-to-point links are generally more expensive than shared 
services such as Frame Relay. Figure 3-2 illustrates a typical point-to-point 
link through a WAN. </font></p>

Switching </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Switched circuits</span> 
allow data connections that can be initiated when needed and terminated when 
communication is complete. This works much like a normal telephone line works 
for voice communication. Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a good 
example of circuit switching. When a router has data for a remote site, the 
switched circuit is initiated with the circuit number of the remote network. In 
the case of ISDN circuits, the device actually places a call to the telephone 
number of the remote ISDN circuit. When the <br>
two networks are connected and authenticated, they can transfer data. When the 
data transmission is complete, the call can be terminated. Figure 3-3 
illustrates an example of this type of circuit. </font></p>

<h2 class="p_H_Head1" align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">Packet 
Switching </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Packet switching</span> is 
a WAN technology in which users share common carrier resources. Because this 
allows the carrier to make more efficient use of its infrastructure, the cost to 
the customer is generally much better than with point-to-point lines. In a 
packet switching setup, networks have connections into the carrier's network, 
and many customers share the carrier's network. The carrier can then create 
virtual circuits between customers' sites by which packets of data are delivered 
from one to the other through the network. The section of the carrier's network 
that is shared is often referred to as a cloud. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Some examples of 
packet-switching networks include Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay, 
Switched Multimegabit Data Services (SMDS), and X.25. Figure <br>
3-4 shows an example packet-switched circuit. </font></p>

<h2 class="p_H_Head1" align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">WAN Virtual 
Circuits </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">A
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">virtual circuit</span> is 
a logical circuit created within a shared network between two network devices. 
Two types of virtual circuits exist: switched virtual circuits (SVCs) and 
permanent virtual circuits (PVCs). </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">SVCs</span> are virtual 
circuits that are dynamically established on demand and terminated when 
transmission is complete. Communication over an SVC consists of three phases: 
circuit establishment, data transfer, and circuit termination. The establishment 
phase involves creating the virtual circuit between the source and destination 
devices. Data transfer involves transmitting data between the devices over the 
virtual circuit, and the circuit termination phase involves tearing down the 
virtual circuit between the source and destination devices. SVCs are used in 
situations in which data transmission between devices is sporadic, largely 
because SVCs increase bandwidth used due to the circuit establishment and 
termination phases, but they decrease the cost associated with constant virtual 
circuit availability. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">PVC</span> is a 
permanently established virtual circuit that consists of one mode: data 
transfer. PVCs are used in situations in which data transfer between devices is 
constant. PVCs decrease the bandwidth use associated with the establishment and 
termination of virtual circuits, but they increase costs due to constant virtual 
circuit availability. PVCs are generally configured by the service provider when 
an order is placed for service. </font></p>
<h2 class="p_H_Head1" align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">WAN Dialup 
Services </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Dialup services offer 
cost-effective methods for connectivity across WANs. Two popular dialup 
implementations are dial-on-demand routing (DDR) and dial backup. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">DDR</span> is a technique 
whereby a router can dynamically initiate a call on a switched circuit when it 
needs to send data. In a DDR setup, the router is configured to initiate the 
call when certain criteria are met, such as a particular type of network traffic 
needing to be transmitted. When the connection is made, traffic passes over the 
line. The router configuration specifies an idle timer that tells the router to 
drop the connection when the circuit has remained idle for a certain period.
</font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Dial backup</span> is 
another way of configuring DDR. However, in dial backup, the switched circuit is 
used to provide backup service for another type of circuit, such as 
point-to-point or packet switching. The router is configured so that when a 
failure is detected on the primary circuit, the dial backup line is initiated. 
The dial backup line then supports the WAN connection until the primary circuit 
is restored. When this occurs, the dial backup connection is terminated. </font>

<h2 class="p_H_Head1" align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">WAN Devices

<p class="pB1_Body1" align="justify"><font face="Arial">WANs use numerous types 
of devices that are specific to WAN environments. WAN switches, access servers, 
modems, CSU/DSUs, and ISDN terminal adapters are discussed in the following 
sections. Other devices found in WAN environments that are used in WAN 
implementations include routers, ATM switches, and multiplexers. </font></p>
