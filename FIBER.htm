<h4 align="justify"><font face="Arial">BRIEF OVER VIEW OF FIBER OPTIC CABLE 
ADVANTAGES OVER COPPER:</font></h4>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">• <b>SPEED:</b> Fiber optic networks 
operate at high speeds - up into the gigabits<br>
• <b>BANDWIDTH:</b> large carrying capacity<br>
• <b>DISTANCE:</b> Signals can be transmitted further without needing to be 
&quot;refreshed&quot; or strengthened.<br>
• <b>RESISTANCE:</b> Greater resistance to electromagnetic noise such as radios, 
motors or other nearby cables.<br>
• <b>MAINTENANCE:</b> Fiber optic cables costs much less to maintain.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
In recent years it has become apparent that fiber-optics are steadily replacing 
copper wire as an appropriate means of communication signal transmission. They 
span the long distances between local phone systems as well as providing the 
backbone for many network systems. Other system users include cable television 
services, university campuses, office buildings, industrial plants, and electric 
utility companies. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A fiber-optic system is similar to the 
copper wire system that fiber-optics is replacing. The difference is that 
fiber-optics use light pulses to transmit information down fiber lines instead 
of using electronic pulses to transmit information down copper lines. Looking at 
the components in a fiber-optic chain will give a better understanding of how 
the system works in conjunction with wire based systems.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">At one end of the system is a transmitter. 
This is the place of origin for information coming on to fiber-optic lines. The 
transmitter accepts coded electronic pulse information coming from copper wire. 
It then processes and translates that information into equivalently coded light 
pulses. A light-emitting diode (LED) or an injection-laser diode (ILD) can be 
used for generating the light pulses. Using a lens, the light pulses are 
funneled into the fiber-optic medium where they transmit themselves down the 
line.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Think of a fiber cable in terms of very 
long cardboard roll (from the inside roll of paper towel) that is coated with a 
mirror.<br>
If you shine a flashlight in one you can see light at the far end - even if bent 
the roll around a corner.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Light pulses move easily down the 
fiber-optic line because of a principle known as total internal reflection. 
&quot;This principle of total internal reflection states that when the angle of 
incidence exceeds a critical value, light cannot get out of the glass; instead, 
the light bounces back in. When this principle is applied to the construction of 
the fiber-optic strand, it is possible to transmit information down fiber lines 
in the form of light pulses.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There are three types of fiber optic cable 
commonly used: single mode, multimode and plastic optical fiber (POF).<br>
<br>
Transparent glass or plastic fibers which allow light to be guided from one end 
to the other with minimal loss.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">

<img src="Fiber%20transmission.gif" border="0" width="721" height="220"></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Fiber optic cable functions as a &quot;light 
guide,&quot; guiding the light introduced at one end of the cable through to the 
other end. The light source can either be a light-emitting diode (LED)) or a 
laser.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The light source is pulsed on and off, and 
a light-sensitive receiver on the other end of the cable converts the pulses 
back into the digital ones and zeros of the original signal.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Even laser light shining through a fiber 
optic cable is subject to loss of strength, primarily through dispersion and 
scattering of the light, within the cable itself. The faster the laser 
fluctuates, the greater the risk of dispersion. Light strengtheners, called 
repeaters, may be necessary to refresh the signal in certain applications.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">While fiber optic cable itself has become 
cheaper over time - a equivalent length of copper cable cost less per foot but 
not in capacity. Fiber optic cable connectors and the equipment needed to 
install them are still more expensive than their copper counterparts.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#0000ff">Single Mode cable</font></b> 
is a single stand of glass fiber with a diameter of 8.3 to 10 microns that has 
one mode of transmission.&nbsp; Single Mode Fiber with a relatively narrow diameter, 
through which only one mode will propagate typically 1310 or 1550nm. Carries 
higher bandwidth than multimode fiber, but requires a light source with a narrow 
spectral width. Synonyms mono-mode optical fiber, single-mode fiber, single-mode 
optical waveguide, uni-mode fiber. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial">Single-mode 
fiber gives you a higher transmission rate and up to 50 times more distance than 
multimode, but it also costs more. Single-mode fiber has a much smaller core 
than multimode. The small core and single light-wave virtually eliminate any 
distortion that could result from overlapping light pulses, providing the least 
signal attenuation and the highest transmission speeds of any fiber cable type.
<O:P />&nbsp; </span><font face="Arial"><br>
<br>
Single-mode optical fiber is an optical fiber in which only the lowest order 
bound mode can propagate at the wavelength of interest typically 1300 to 1320nm.

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
<b><font color="#0000ff">Multimode cable</font></b> is made of of glass fibers, 
with a common diameters in the 50-to-100 micron range for the light carry 
component (the most common size is 62.5).&nbsp; POF is a newer plastic-based cable 
which promises performance similar to glass cable on very short runs, but at a 
lower cost. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial">Multimode 
fiber gives you high bandwidth at high speeds over medium distances. Light waves 
are dispersed into numerous paths, or modes, as they travel through the cable's 
core typically 850 or 1300nm. Typical multimode fiber core diameters are 50, 
62.5, and 100 micrometers. However, in long cable runs (greater than 3000 feet 
[914.4 meters), multiple paths of light can cause signal distortion at the 
receiving end, resulting in an unclear and incomplete data transmission.

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The use of fiber-optics was generally not 
available until 1970 when Corning Glass Works was able to produce a fiber with a 
loss of 20 dB/km. It was recognized that optical fiber would be feasible for 
telecommunication transmission only if glass could be developed so pure that 
attenuation would be 20dB/km or less. That is, 1% of the light would remain 
after traveling 1 km. Today's optical fiber attenuation ranges from 0.5dB/km to 
1000dB/km depending on the optical fiber used. Attenuation limits are based on 
intended application.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The applications of optical fiber 
communications have increased at a rapid rate, since the first commercial 
installation of a fiber-optic system in 1977. Telephone companies began early 
on, replacing their old copper wire systems with optical fiber lines. Today's 
telephone companies use optical fiber throughout their system as the backbone 
architecture and as the long-distance connection between city phone systems.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Cable television companies have also began 
integrating fiber-optics into their cable systems. The trunk lines that connect 
central offices have generally been replaced with optical fiber. Some providers 
have begun experimenting with fiber to the curb using a fiber/coaxial hybrid. 
Such a hybrid allows for the integration of fiber and coaxial at a neighborhood 
location. This location, called a node, would provide the optical receiver that 
converts the light impulses back to electronic signals. The signals could then 
be fed to individual homes via coaxial cable.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Local Area Networks (LAN) is a collective 
group of computers, or computer systems, connected to each other allowing for 
shared program software or data bases. Colleges, universities, office buildings, 
and industrial plants, just to name a few, all make use of optical fiber within 
their LAN systems.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Power companies are an emerging group that 
have begun to utilize fiber-optics in their communication systems. Most power 
utilities already have fiber-optic communication systems in use for monitoring 
their power grid systems.</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">Fiber </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Some 10 billion digital bits can be 
transmitted per second along an optical fiber link in a commercial network, 
enough to carry tens of thousands of telephone calls. Hair-thin fibers consist 
of two concentric layers of high-purity silica glass the core and the cladding, 
which are enclosed by a protective sheath. Light rays modulated into digital 
pulses with a laser or a light-emitting diode move along the core without 
penetrating the cladding.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The light stays confined to the core 
because the cladding has a lower refractive index—a measure of its ability to 
bend light. Refinements in optical fibers, along with the development of new 
lasers and diodes, may one day allow commercial fiber-optic networks to carry 
trillions of bits of data per second.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;Total internal refection confines light 
within optical fibers (similar to looking down a mirror made in the shape of a 
long paper towel tube). Because the cladding has a lower refractive index, light 
rays reflect back into the core if they encounter the cladding at a shallow 
angle (red lines). A ray that exceeds a certain &quot;critical&quot; angle escapes from 
the fiber (yellow line).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff">STEP-INDEX MULTIMODE 
FIBER</font> has a large core, up to 100 microns in diameter. As a result, some 
of the light rays that make up the digital pulse may travel a direct route, 
whereas others zigzag as they bounce off the cladding. These alternative 
pathways cause the different groupings of light rays, referred to as modes, to 
arrive separately at a receiving point. The pulse, an aggregate of different 
modes, begins to spread out, losing its well-defined shape. The need to leave 
spacing between pulses to prevent overlapping limits bandwidth that is, the 
amount of information that can be sent. Consequently, this type of fiber is best 
suited for transmission over short distances, in an endoscope, for instance.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff">GRADED-INDEX 
MULTIMODE FIBER</font> contains a core in which the refractive index diminishes 
gradually from the center axis out toward the cladding. The higher refractive 
index at the center makes the light rays moving down the axis advance more 
slowly than those near the cladding. Also, rather than zigzagging off the 
cladding, light in the core curves helically because of the graded index, 
reducing its travel distance. The shortened path and the higher speed allow 
light at the periphery to arrive at a receiver at about the same time as the 
slow but straight rays in the core axis. The result: a digital pulse suffers 
less dispersion.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff">SINGLE-MODE FIBER</font> 
has a narrow core (eight microns or less), and the index of refraction between 
the core and the cladding changes less than it does for multimode fibers. Light 
thus travels parallel to the axis, creating little pulse dispersion. Telephone 
and cable television networks install millions of kilometers of this fiber every 
year.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><b><a name="Top"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff">BASIC 
CABLE DESIGN</font></a></b></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">1 - Two basic cable designs 
are:</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">Loose-tube cable, used in 
the majority of outside-plant installations in North America, and tight-buffered 
cable, primarily used inside buildings.</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">The modular design of 
loose-tube cables typically holds up to 12 fibers per buffer tube with a maximum 
per cable fiber count of more than 200 fibers. Loose-tube cables can be 
all-dielectric or optionally armored. The modular buffer-tube design permits 
easy drop-off of groups of fibers at intermediate points, without interfering 
with other protected buffer tubes being routed to other locations. The 
loose-tube design also helps in the identification and administration of fibers 
in the system.</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">Single-fiber tight-buffered 
cables are used as pigtails, patch cords and jumpers to terminate loose-tube 
cables directly into opto-electronic transmitters, receivers and other active 
and passive components.</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">Multi-fiber tight-buffered 
cables also are available and are used primarily for alternative routing and 
handling flexibility and ease within buildings.</font></a></p>
<h3 align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial" size="3">2 - Loose-Tube 
Cable</font></a></h3>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">In a loose-tube cable 
design, color-coded plastic buffer tubes house and protect optical fibers. A gel 
filling compound impedes water penetration. Excess fiber length (relative to 
buffer tube length) insulates fibers from stresses of installation and 
environmental loading. Buffer tubes are stranded around a dielectric or steel 
central member, which serves as an anti-buckling element.</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">The cable core, typically 
uses aramid yarn, as the primary tensile strength member. The outer polyethylene 
jacket is extruded over the core. If armoring is required, a corrugated steel 
tape is formed around a single jacketed cable with an additional jacket extruded 
over the armor.</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">Loose-tube cables typically 
are used for outside-plant installation in aerial, duct and direct-buried 
applications.</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial" size="3">3 - Tight-Buffered 
Cable</font></a></h3>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">With tight-buffered cable 
designs, the buffering material is in direct contact with the fiber. This design 
is suited for &quot;jumper cables&quot; which connect outside plant cables to terminal 
equipment, and also for linking various devices in a premises network.</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">Multi-fiber, tight-buffered 
cables often are used for intra-building, risers, general building and plenum 
applications.</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">The tight-buffered design 
provides a rugged cable structure to protect individual fibers during handling, 
routing and connectorization. Yarn strength members keep the tensile load away 
from the fiber.</font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="Top"><font face="Arial">As with loose-tube cables, 
optical specifications for tight-buffered cables also should include the maximum 
performance of all fibers over the operating temperature range and life of the 
cable. Averages should not be acceptable.</font></a></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>What's the best way to terminate fiber 
optic cable? </b>That depends on the application, cost considerations and your 
own personal preferences. The following connector comparisons can make the 
decision easier.<br>
<br>
Epoxy &amp; Polish<br>
<br>
Epoxy &amp; polish style connectors were the original fiber optic connectors. They 
still represent the largest segment of connectors, in both quantity used and 
variety available. Practically every style of connector is available including 
ST, SC, FC, LC, D4, SMA, MU, and MTRJ. Advantages include:<br>
<br>
• Very robust. This connector style is based on tried and true technology, and 
can withstand the greatest environmental and mechanical stress when compared to 
the other connector technologies.<br>
• This style of connector accepts the widest assortment of cable jacket 
diameters. Most connectors of this group have versions to fit onto 900um 
buffered fiber, and up to 3.0mm jacketed fiber.<br>
• Versions are. available that hold from 1 to 24 fibers in a single connector.<br>
<br>
Installation Time: There is an initial setup time for the field technician who 
must prepare a workstation with polishing equipment and an epoxy-curing oven. 
The termination time for one connector is about 25 minutes due to the time 
needed to heat cure the epoxy. Average time per connector in a large batch can 
be as low as 5 or 6 minutes. Faster curing epoxies such as anaerobic epoxy can 
reduce the installation time, but fast cure epoxies are not suitable for all 
connectors.<br>
<br>
Skill Level: These connectors, while not difficult to install, do require the 
most supervised skills training, especially for polishing. They are best suited 
for the high-volume installer or assembly house with a trained and stable work 
force.<br>
<br>
Costs: Least expensive connectors to purchase, in many cases being 30 to 50 
percent cheaper than other termination style connectors. However, factor in the 
cost of epoxy curing and ferrule polishing equipment, and their associated 
consumables.<br>
<br>
Pre-Loaded Epoxy or No-Epoxy &amp; Polish<br>
<br>
There are two main categories of no-epoxy &amp; polish connectors. The first are 
connectors that are pre-loaded with a measured amount of epoxy. These connectors 
reduce the skill level needed to install a connector but they don't 
significantly reduce the time or equipment need-ed. The second category of 
connectors uses no epoxy at all. Usually they use an internal crimp mechanism to 
stabilize the fiber. These connectors reduce both the skill level needed and 
installation time. ST, SC, and FC connector styles are available. Advantages 
include:<br>
<br>
• Epoxy injection is not required.<br>
• No scraped connectors due to epoxy over-fill.<br>
• Reduced equipment requirements for some versions.<br>
<br>
Installation Time: Both versions have short setup time, with pre-loaded epoxy 
connectors having a slightly longer setup. Due to curing time, the pre-loaded 
epoxy connectors require the same amount of installation time as standard 
connectors, 25 minutes for 1 connector, 5-6 minutes average for a batch. 
Connectors that use the internal crimp method install in 2 minutes or less.<br>
<br>
Skill Level: Skill requirements are reduced because the crimp mechanism is 
easier to master than using epoxy. They provide maximum flexibility with one 
technology and a balance between skill and cost.<br>
<br>
Costs: Moderately more expensive to purchase than a standard connector. 
Equipment cost is equal to or less than that of standard con¬nectors. Consumable 
cost is reduced to polish film and cleaning sup-plies. Cost benefits derive from 
reduced training requirements and fast installation time.<br>
<br>
No-Epoxy &amp; No-Polish<br>
<br>
Easiest and fastest connectors to install; well suited for contractors who 
cannot cost-justify the training and supervision required for standard 
connectors. Good solution for fast field restorations. ST, SC, FC, LC, and MTRJ 
connector styles are available. Advantages include:<br>
• No setup time required.<br>
• Lowest installation time per connector.<br>
• Limited training required.<br>
• Little or no consumables costs.<br>
<br>
Installation Time: Almost zero. Its less than 1 minute regardless of number of 
connectors.<br>
<br>
Skill level: Requires minimal training, making this type of connector ideal for 
installation companies with a high turnover rate of installers and/or that do 
limited amounts of optical-fiber terminations.<br>
<br>
Costs: Generally the most expensive style connector to purchase, since some of 
the labor (polishing) is done in the factory. Also, one or two fairly expensive 
installation tools may be required. However, it may still be less expensive on a 
cost-per-installed-connector basis due to lower labor cost.</font></p>
