<span style="font-family: Arial">Security.</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">UUCP(Unix-to-Unix Copy), like any other 
application, has security tradeoffs. Some strong points for its security is that 
it is fairly limited in what it can do, and it's therefore more difficult to 
trick into doing something it shouldn't; it's been around a <em>long</em> time, 
and most its bugs have been discovered, analyzed, and fixed; and because UUCP 
networks are made up of occasional connections to other hosts, it isn't possible 
for someone on host <tt style="font-family: Courier New">
<span style="font-family: Arial">E</span></tt> to directly make contact with 
host <tt style="font-family: Courier New"><span style="font-family: Arial">B</span></tt>, 
and take advantage of that connection to do something naughty. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">On the other 
hand, UUCP typically works by having a system-wide UUCP user account and 
password. Any system that has a UUCP connection with another must know the 
appropriate password for the <tt style="font-family: Courier New">
<span style="font-family: Arial">uucp</span></tt> or
<tt style="font-family: Courier New"><span style="font-family: Arial">nuucp</span></tt> 
account. Identifying a host beyond that point has traditionally been little more 
than a matter of trusting that the host is who it claims to be, and that a 
connection is allowed at that time. More recently, there has been an additional 
layer of authentication, whereby both hosts must have the same <em>sequence 
number</em> , that is a number that is incremented each time a connection is 
made.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Understanding IP </span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">IP has a number of very important features 
which make it an extremely robust and flexible protocol. For our purposes, 
though, we're going to focus on the security of IP, or more specifically, the 
lack thereof. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a name="SECTION00032200000000000000">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Attacks Against IP</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">
</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">A number of attacks against IP are possible. 
Typically, these exploit the fact that IP does not perform a robust mechanism 
for <em>authentication</em> , which is proving that a packet came from where it 
claims it did. A packet simply claims to originate from a given address, and 
there isn't a way to be sure that the host that sent the packet is telling the 
truth. This isn't necessarily a weakness, <em>per se</em> , but it is an 
important point, because it means that the facility of host authentication has 
to be provided at a higher layer on the ISO/OSI Reference Model. Today, 
applications that require strong host authentication (such as cryptographic 
applications) do this at the application layer. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify"><a name="SECTION00032210000000000000">
<span style="font-family: Arial">IP Spoofing.</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">This is where one host claims to have the IP 
address of another. Since many systems (such as router access control lists) 
define which packets may and which packets may not pass based on the sender's IP 
address, this is a useful technique to an attacker: he can send packets to a 
host, perhaps causing it to take some sort of action. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Additionally, 
some applications allow login based on the IP address of the person making the 
request (such as the Berkeley <em>r-commands</em> )[</span><a href="http://www.interhack.net/pubs/network-security/network-security.html#rtm:42bsd-weak" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span style="font-family: Arial">2</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial">]. 
These are both good examples how trusting untrustable layers can provide 
security that is -- at best -- weak. </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial">IP Session Hijacking.</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></h4>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">This is 
a relatively sophisticated attack, first described by Steve Bellovin. This is 
very dangerous, however, because there are now toolkits available in the 
underground community that allow otherwise unskilled bad-guy-wannabes to 
perpetrate this attack. IP Session Hijacking is an attack whereby a user's 
session is taken over, being in the control of the attacker. If the user was in 
the middle of email, the attacker is looking at the email, and then can execute 
any commands he wishes as the attacked user. The attacked user simply sees his 
session dropped, and may simply login again, perhaps not even noticing that the 
attacker is still logged in and doing things.</span></h2>

</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><em>
<span style="font-family: Arial">DoS</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
(Denial-of-Service) attacks are probably the nastiest, and most difficult to 
address. These are the nastiest, because they're very easy to launch, difficult 
(sometimes impossible) to track, and it isn't easy to refuse the requests of the 
attacker, without also refusing legitimate requests for service. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The premise of a 
DoS attack is simple: send more requests to the machine than it can handle. 
There are toolkits available in the underground community that make this a 
simple matter of running a program and telling it which host to blast with 
requests. The attacker's program simply makes a connection on some service port, 
perhaps forging the packet's header information that says where the packet came 
from, and then dropping the connection. If the host is able to answer 20 
requests per second, and the attacker is sending 50 per second, obviously the 
host will be unable to service all of the attacker's requests, much less any 
legitimate requests (hits on the web site running there, for example). </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Such attacks 
were fairly common in late 1996 and early 1997, but are now becoming less 
popular. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Some things that 
can be done to reduce the risk of being stung by a denial of service attack 
include </span></p>

</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">``Unauthorized access'' is a very high-level 
term that can refer to a number of different sorts of attacks. The goal of these 
attacks is to access some resource that your machine should not provide the 
attacker. For example, a host might be a web server, and should provide anyone 
with requested web pages. However, that host should not provide command shell 
access without being sure that the person making such a request is someone who 
should get it, such as a local administrator. </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Executing Commands Illicitly</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">
</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">It's obviously undesirable for an unknown and 
untrusted person to be able to execute commands on your server machines. There 
are two main classifications of the severity of this problem: normal user 
access, and administrator access. A normal user can do a number of things on a 
system (such as read files, mail them to other people, etc.) that an attacker 
should not be able to do. This might, then, be all the access that an attacker 
needs. On the other hand, an attacker might wish to make configuration changes 
to a host (perhaps changing its IP address, putting a start-up script in place 
to cause the machine to shut down every time it's started, or something 
similar). In this case, the attacker will need to gain administrator privileges 
on the host. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">We need to examine the threat model: what is it 
that you're trying to protect yourself against? There is certain information 
that could be quite damaging if it fell into the hands of a competitor, an 
enemy, or the public. In these cases, it's possible that compromise of a normal 
user's account on the machine can be enough to cause damage (perhaps in the form 
of PR, or obtaining information that can be used against the company, etc.)
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">While many of 
the perpetrators of these sorts of break-ins are merely thrill-seekers 
interested in nothing more than to see a shell prompt for your computer on their 
screen, there are those who are more malicious, as we'll consider next. 
(Additionally, keep in mind that it's possible that someone who is normally 
interested in nothing more than the thrill could be persuaded to do more: 
perhaps an unscrupulous competitor is willing to hire such a person to hurt 
you.) </span></p>

</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">Among the destructive sorts of break-ins and 
attacks, there are two major categories. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify"><a name="SECTION00052310000000000000">
<span style="font-family: Arial">Data Diddling.</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The data diddler is likely the worst sort, 
since the fact of a break-in might not be immediately obvious. Perhaps he's 
toying with the numbers in your spreadsheets, or changing the dates in your 
projections and plans. Maybe he's changing the account numbers for the 
auto-deposit of certain paychecks. In any case, rare is the case when you'll 
come in to work one day, and simply know that something is wrong. An accounting 
procedure might turn up a discrepancy in the books three or four months after 
the fact. Trying to track the problem down will certainly be difficult, and once
<em>that</em> problem is discovered, how can any of your numbers from that time 
period be trusted? How far back do you have to go before you think that your 
data is safe? </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial">Data Destruction.</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></h4>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Some of 
those perpetrate attacks are simply twisted jerks who like to delete things. In 
these cases, the impact on your computing capability -- and consequently your 
business -- can be nothing less than if a fire or other disaster caused your 
computing equipment to be completely destroyed.</span></h2>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Firewalls</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">
</span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">As we've seen in our discussion of the Internet 
and similar networks, connecting an organization to the Internet provides a 
two-way flow of traffic. This is clearly undesirable in many organizations, as 
proprietary information is often displayed freely within a corporate <em>
intranet</em> (that is, a TCP/IP network, modeled after the Internet that only 
works within the organization). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">In order to 
provide some level of separation between an organization's intranet and the 
Internet, <em>firewalls</em> have been employed. A firewall is simply a group of 
components that collectively form a barrier between two networks. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">A number of 
terms specific to firewalls and networking are going to be used throughout this 
section, so let's introduce them all together. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><strong>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Bastion host.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Arial">A general-purpose computer used to control 
access between the internal (private) network (intranet) and the Internet (or 
any other untrusted network). Typically, these are hosts running a flavor of the 
Unix operating system that has been customized in order to reduce its 
functionality to only what is necessary in order to support its functions. Many 
of the general-purpose features have been turned off, and in many cases, 
completely removed, in order to improve the security of the machine. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><strong>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Router.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Arial">A special purpose computer for connecting 
networks together. Routers also handle certain functions, such as <em>routing</em> 
, or managing the traffic on the networks they connect. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><strong>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Access Control List (ACL).</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Arial">Many routers now have the ability to 
selectively perform their duties, based on a number of facts about a packet that 
comes to it. This includes things like origination address, destination address, 
destination service port, and so on. These can be employed to limit the sorts of 
packets that are allowed to come in and go out of a given network. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><strong>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The DMZ is a critical part of a firewall: it is 
a network that is neither part of the untrusted network, nor part of the trusted 
network. But, this is a network that connects the untrusted to the trusted. The 
importance of a DMZ is tremendous: someone who breaks into your network from the 
Internet should have to get through several layers in order to successfully do 
so. Those layers are provided by various components within the DMZ. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><strong>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Proxy.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial">
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Arial">This is the process of having one host act in 
behalf of another. A host that has the ability to fetch documents from the 
Internet might be configured as a <em>proxy server</em> , and host on the 
intranet might be configured to be <em>proxy clients</em> . In this situation, 
when a host on the intranet wishes to fetch the
<tt style="font-family: Courier New"><span style="font-family: Arial">&lt;http://www.interhack.net/&gt;</span></tt> 
web page, for example, the browser will make a connection to the proxy server, 
and request the given URL. The proxy server will fetch the document, and return 
the result to the client. In this way, all hosts on the intranet are able to 
access resources on the Internet without having the ability to direct talk to 
the Internet. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify"><a name="SECTION00061000000000000000">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Types of Firewalls</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">
</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">There are three basic types of firewalls, and 
we'll consider each of them. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a name="SECTION00061100000000000000">

</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The first firewalls were application gateways, 
and are sometimes known as proxy gateways. These are made up of bastion hosts 
that run special software to act as a proxy server. This software runs at the
<em>Application Layer</em> of our old friend the ISO/OSI Reference Model, hence 
the name. Clients behind the firewall must be <em>proxitized</em> (that is, must 
know how to use the proxy, and be configured to do so) in order to use Internet 
services. Traditionally, these have been the most secure, because they don't 
allow anything to pass by default, but need to have the programs written and 
turned on in order to begin passing traffic. </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Packet Filtering</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">
</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">Packet filtering is a technique whereby routers 
have <em>ACLs</em> (Access Control Lists) turned on. By default, a router will 
pass all traffic sent it, and will do so without any sort of restrictions. 
Employing ACLs is a method for enforcing your security policy with regard to 
what sorts of access you allow the outside world to have to your internal 
network, and vice versa. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">There is less 
overhead in packet filtering than with an application gateway, because the 
feature of access control is performed at a lower ISO/OSI layer (typically, the 
transport or session layer). Due to the lower overhead and the fact that packet 
filtering is done with routers, which are specialized computers optimized for 
tasks related to networking, a packet filtering gateway is often much faster 
than its application layer cousins. Figure&nbsp;6 
shows a packet filtering gateway. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Because we're 
working at a lower level, supporting new applications either comes 
automatically, or is a simple matter of allowing a specific packet type to pass 
through the gateway. (Not that the <em>possibility</em> of something 
automatically makes it a good idea; opening things up this way might very well 
compromise your level of security below what your policy allows.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">There are 
problems with this method, though. Remember, TCP/IP has absolutely no means of 
guaranteeing that the source address is really what it claims to be. As a 
result, we have to use layers of packet filters in order to localize the 
traffic. We can't get all the way down to the actual host, but with two layers 
of packet filters, we can differentiate between a packet that came from the 
Internet and one that came from our internal network. We can identify which 
network the packet came from with certainty, but we can't get more specific than

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Secure 
Modems; Dial-Back Systems </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">If modem access is to be provided, this should 
be guarded carefully. The <em>terminal server</em> , or network device that 
provides dial-up access to your network needs to be actively administered, and 
its logs need to be examined for strange behavior. Its passwords need to be 
strong -- not ones that can be guessed. Accounts that aren't actively used 
should be disabled. In short, it's the easiest way to get into your network from 
remote: guard it carefully. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">There are some 
remote access systems that have the feature of a two-part procedure to establish 
a connection. The first part is the remote user dialing into the system, and 
providing the correct userid and password. The system will then drop the 
connection, and call the authenticated user back at a known telephone number. 
Once the remote user's system answers that call, the connection is established, 
and the user is on the network. This works well for folks working at home, but 
can be problematic for users wishing to dial in from hotel rooms and such when 
on business trips. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Other 
possibilities include one-time password schemes, where the user enters his 
userid, and is presented with a ``challenge,'' a string of between six and eight 
numbers. He types this challenge into a small device that he carries with him 
that looks like a calculator. He then presses enter, and a ``response'' is 
displayed on the LCD screen. The user types the response, and if all is correct, 
he login will proceed. These are useful devices for solving the problem of good 
passwords, without requiring dial-back access. However, these have their own 
problems, as they require the user to carry them, and they must be tracked, much 
like building and office keys. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">No doubt many 
other schemes exist. Take a look at your options, and find out how what the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">Given the ubiquity of the Internet, and the 
considerable expense in private leased lines, many organizations have been 
building <em>VPNs</em> (Virtual Private Networks). Traditionally, for an 
organization to provide connectivity between a main office and a satellite one, 
an expensive data line had to be leased in order to provide direct connectivity 
between the two offices. Now, a solution that is often more economical is to 
provide both offices connectivity to the Internet. Then, using the Internet as 
the medium, the two offices can communicate. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">The danger in 
doing this, of course, is that there is no privacy on this channel, and it's 
difficult to provide the other office access to ``internal'' resources without 
providing those resources to everyone on the Internet. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">VPNs provide the 
ability for two offices to communicate with each other in such a way that it 
looks like they're directly connected over a private leased line. The session 
between them, although going over the Internet, is private (because the link is 
encrypted), and the link is convenient, because each can see each others' 
internal resources without showing them off to the entire world. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">A number of 
firewall vendors are including the ability to build VPNs in their offerings, 
either directly with their base product, or as an add-on. If you have need to 
connect several offices together, this might very well be the best way to do it.

Technology</span></a></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">A 
variety of technologies have been developed to help organizations secure their 
systems and information against intruders. These technologies help protect 
systems and information against attacks, detect unusual or suspicious 
activities, and respond to events that affect security. In this section, the 
focus is on two core areas: operational technology and cryptography. The purpose 
of operational technology is to maintain and defend the availability of data 
resources in a secure manner. The purpose of cryptography is to secure the 
confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data resources. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a name="OpTech"><b><i>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Operational Technology</span></i></b></a><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Intruders actively seek ways to access networks and hosts. Armed with knowledge 
about specific vulnerabilities, social engineering techniques, and tools to 
automate information gathering and systems infiltration, intruders can often 
gain entry into systems with disconcerting ease. System administrators face the 
dilemma of maximizing the availability of system services to valid users while 
minimizing the susceptibility of complex network infrastructures to attack. 
Unfortunately, services often depend on the same characteristics of systems and 
network protocols that make them susceptible to compromise by intruders. In 
response, technologies have evolved to reduce the impact of such threats. No 
single technology addresses all the problems. Nevertheless, organizations can 
significantly improve their resistance to attack by carefully preparing and 
strategically deploying personnel and operational technologies. Data resources 
and assets can be protected, suspicious activity can be detected and assessed, 
and appropriate responses can be made to security events as they occur.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a name="OTP"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">One-Time Passwords.</span></b></a><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black"> 
Intruders often install packet sniffers to capture passwords as they traverse 
networks during remote log-in processes. Therefore, all passwords should at 
least be encrypted as they traverse networks. A better solution is to use 
one-time passwords because there are times when a password is required to 
initiate a connection before confidentiality can be protected. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
One common example occurs in remote dial-up connections. Remote users, such as 
those traveling on business, dial in to their organization's modem pool to 
access network and data resources. To identify and authenticate themselves to 
the dial-up server, they must enter a user ID and password. Because this initial 
exchange between the user and server may be monitored by intruders, it is 
essential that the passwords are not reusable. In other words, intruders should 
not be able to gain access by masquerading as a legitimate user using a password 
they have captured. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
One-time password technologies address this problem. Remote users carry a device 
synchronized with software and hardware on the dial-up server. The device 
displays random passwords, each of which remains in effect for a limited time 
period (typically 60 seconds). These passwords are never repeated and are valid 
only for a specific user during the period that each is displayed. In addition, 
users are often limited to one successful use of any given password. One-time 
password technologies significantly reduce unauthorized entry at gateways 
requiring an initial password. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a name="Firewalls"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Firewalls</span></b></a><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black"> 
Intruders often attempt to gain access to networked systems by pretending to 
initiate connections from trusted hosts. They squash the emissions of the 
genuine host using a denial-of-service attack and then attempt to connect to a 
target system using the address of the genuine host. To counter these 
address-spoofing attacks and enforce limitations on authorized connections into 
the organizations network, it is necessary to filter all incoming and outgoing 
network traffic. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">A 
firewall is a collection of hardware and software designed to examine a stream 
of network traffic and service requests. Its purpose is to eliminate from the 
stream those packets or requests that fail to meet the security criteria 
established by the organization. A simple firewall may consist of a filtering 
router, configured to discard packets that arrive from unauthorized addresses or 
that represent attempts to connect to unauthorized service ports. More 
sophisticated implementations may include bastion hosts, on which proxy 
mechanisms operate on behalf of services. These mechanisms authenticate 
requests, verify their form and content, and relay approved service requests to 
the appropriate service hosts. Because firewalls are typically the first line of 
defense against intruders, their configuration must be carefully implemented and 
tested before connections are established between internal networks and the 
Internet. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a name="MonTools"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Monitoring Tools</span></b></a><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">. 
Continuous monitoring of network activity is required if a site is to maintain 
confidence in the security of its network and data resources. Network monitors 
may be installed at strategic locations to collect and examine information 
continuously that may indicate suspicious activity. It is possible to have 
automatic notifications alert system administrators when the monitor detects 
anomalous readings, such as a burst of activity that may indicate a 
denial-of-service attempt. Such notifications may use a variety of channels, 
including electronic mail and mobile paging. Sophisticated systems capable of 
reacting to questionable network activity may be implemented to disconnect and 
block suspect connections, limit or disable affected services, isolate affected 
systems, and collect evidence for subsequent analysis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Tools to scan, monitor, and eradicate viruses can identify and destroy malicious 
programs that may have inadvertently been transmitted onto host systems. The 
damage potential of viruses ranges from mere annoyance (e.g., an unexpected 
&quot;Happy Holidays&quot; jingle without further effect) to the obliteration of critical 
data resources. To ensure continued protection, the virus identification data on 
which such tools depend must be kept up to date. Most virus tool vendors provide 
subscription services or other distribution facilities to help customers keep up 
to date with the latest viral strains. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a name="SAT"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Security Analysis Tools.</span></b></a><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black"> 
Because of the increasing sophistication of intruder methods and the 
vulnerabilities present in commonly used applications, it is essential to assess 
periodically network susceptibility to compromise. A variety of vulnerability 
identification tools are available, which have garnered both praise and 
criticism. System administrators find these tools useful in identifying 
weaknesses in their systems. Critics argue that such tools, especially those 
freely available to the Internet community, pose a threat if acquired and 
misused by intruders. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a name="Crypt"><b><i>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Cryptography</span></i></b></a><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
One of the primary reasons that intruders can be successful is that most of the 
information they acquire from a system is in a form that they can read and 
comprehend. When you consider the millions of electronic messages that traverse 
the Internet each day, it is easy to see how a well-placed network snuffer might 
capture a wealth of information that users would not like to have disclosed to 
unintended readers. Intruders may reveal the information to others, modify it to 
misrepresent an individual or organization, or use it to launch an attack. One 
solution to this problem is, through the use of cryptography, to prevent 
intruders from being able to use the information that they capture. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Encryption is the process of translating information from its original form 
(called <i>plaintext</i>) into an encoded, incomprehensible form (called <i>
ciphertext</i>). Decryption refers to the process of taking ciphertext and 
translating it back into plaintext. Any type of data may be encrypted, including 
digitized images and sounds. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Cryptography secures information by protecting its confidentiality. Cryptography 
can also be used to protect information about the integrity and authenticity of 
data. For example, checksums are often used to verify the integrity of a block 
of information. A checksum, which is a number calculated from the contents of a 
file, can be used to determine if the contents are correct. An intruder, 
however, may be able to forge the checksum after modifying the block of 
information. Unless the checksum is protected, such modification might not be 
detected. Cryptographic checksums (also called message digests) help prevent 
undetected modification of information by encrypting the checksum in a way that 
makes the checksum unique. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
The authenticity of data can be protected in a similar way. For example, to 
transmit information to a colleague by E-mail, the sender first encrypts the 
information to protect its confidentiality and then attaches an encrypted 
digital signature to the message. When the colleague receives the message, he or 
she checks the origin of the message by using a key to verify the sender's 
digital signature and decrypts the information using the corresponding 
decryption key. To protect against the chance of intruders modifying or forging 
the information in transit, digital signatures are formed by encrypting a 
combination of a checksum of the information and the author's unique private 
key. A side effect of such authentication is the concept of no repudiation. A 
person who places their cryptographic digital signature on an electronic 
document cannot later claim that they did not sign it, since in theory they are 
the only one who could have created the correct signature. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Current laws in several countries, including the United States, restrict 
cryptographic technology from export or import across national borders. In the 
era of the Internet, it is particularly important to be aware of all applicable 
local and foreign regulations governing the use of cryptography. </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Information Warfare</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Extensive and widespread dependence on the Internet has called new attention to 
the importance of information to national security. The term <i>information 
warfare</i> refers to the act of war against the information resources of an 
adversary. Like warfare on land or in the air, information warfare is one 
component of a range of attack strategies for dominating an adversary in order 
to gain or maintain an objective. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Information warfare is divided into two categories: offensive and defensive. The 
purpose of offensive information warfare is to attack the information resources 
of an adversary to gain dominance. Defensive information warfare is the 
protection of your information assets against attack. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Information assets can take many forms, from messages sent by courier in 
diplomatic bags to the computers used to analyze enemy positions based on 
satellite data. In computer security, information assets include digital 
information, the computers that process them, and the networks that transmit the 
digital information from place to place. Computer security is a key element for 
protecting the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of all these 
information assets. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Internet security protects information assets consisting of computers, 
information, and networks that are part of the Internet. Internet security is 
related to information warfare when the Internet contains information assets 
that are important to the information warfare objective. For example, if an 
adversary can use the Internet to access battle plans, the Internet is being 
used for information warfare. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Internet security is important to both offensive and defensive information 
warfare because the Internet is a global and dependable resource on which many 
countries rely. Historically, military networks and computers were unreachable 
by nonmilitary participants. The Internet, however, provides a cost-effective 
way for military and government units to communicate and participate in 
achieving objectives. Use of the Internet means that individuals, multinational 
companies, and terrorist organizations all can gain access to important 
information resources of governments and military forces. Thus, it is important 
to address Internet security concerns as a key component of defensive 
information warfare. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Because the Internet is global, it can be an avenue of attack for offensive 
information warfare by many governments. One of the battlefields for a future 
military offensive could very well involve the Internet. Intruder technology (as 
described in a separate section above) could be used by a government as a weapon 
against information resources, or used randomly by a terrorist organization 
against civilian targets. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">In 
the study of information warfare, there are many new problems to solve that are 
not evident in other forms of warfare. These problems include identifying the 
enemy, responding without making your systems vulnerable to attack, and 
gathering intelligence on the Internet about preparations for a military 
exercise. These and other problems are likely to be the subject of discussion 
and investigation for some time to come. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Most of the network protocols currently in use have changed little since the 
early definitions of the ARPA research and education network when trust was the 
norm. To have a secure foundation for the critical Internet applications of the 
future, severe weaknesses must be addressed: lack of encryption to preserve 
privacy, lack of cryptographic authentication to identify the source of 
information, and lack of cryptographic checksums to preserve the integrity of 
data (and the integrity of the packet routing information itself). New 
internetworking protocols are under development which uses cryptography to 
authenticate the originator of a packet and to protect the integrity and 
confidentiality of data. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) Proposed Standard for the Next 
Generation Internet Protocol (IPng) is being designed to cope with the vastly 
increased addressing and routing needs associated with the exponential growth of 
the Internet. IPng provides integral support for authenticating hosts and 
protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
The first release of IPng is officially termed IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 
6). Since it is impractical to replace the existing protocol instantly and 
simultaneously throughout the Internet, IPv6 is designed to coexist with the 
current version of IP, allowing for a gradual transition over the course of 
years. Implementations of IPv6 for many routers and host operating systems are 
underway. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">In 
the future, authentication protocols will increasingly be supported by 
technology that authenticates individuals (in the context of their 
organizational or personal roles) through the use of smart cards, fingerprint 
readers, voice recognition, retina scans, and so forth. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Protocol design, analysis, and implementation will be the subject of continued 
research. A primary goal is 100% verifiably secure protocols (that is, protocols 
as provably secure as the cryptographic algorithms supporting them), but 
researchers are nowhere near attaining this goal. </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Intrusion Detection</span></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Research is underway to improve the ability of networked systems and their 
managers to determine that they are, or have been, under attack. Intrusion 
detection is recognized as a problematic area of research that is still in its 
infancy. There are two major areas of research in intrusion detection: anomaly 
detection and pattern recognition. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Research in anomaly detection is based on determining patterns of &quot;normal&quot; 
behavior for networks, hosts, and users and then detecting behavior that is 
significantly different (anomalous). Patterns of normal behavior are frequently 
determined through data collection over a period of time sufficient to obtain a 
good sample of the typical behavior of authorized users and processes. The basic 
difficulty facing researchers is that normal behavior is highly variable based 
on a wide variety of innocuous factors. Many of the activities of intruders are 
indistinguishable from the benign actions of an authorized user. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
The second major area of intrusion detection research is pattern recognition. 
The goal here is to detect patterns of network, host, and user activity that 
match known intruder attack scenarios. One problem with this approach is the 
variability that is possible within a single overall attack strategy. A second 
problem is that new attacks, with new attack patterns, cannot be detected by 
this approach. </span><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
