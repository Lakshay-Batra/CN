<font face="Arial" color="#FF0000" size="6"><b>public switched telephone network</b></font></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">The
<b>public switched telephone network</b> (<b>PSTN</b>) is the concentration of 
the world's public circuit-switched telephone networks, in much the same way 
that the Internet is the concentration of the world's public IP-based 
packet-switched networks. Originally a network of fixed-line analog telephone 
systems, the PSTN is now almost entirely digital and now includes mobile as well 
as fixed telephones.</font></span><font size="3"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"></font><span style="font-family:Arial">
<font size="3">The PSTN is largely governed by technical standards created by 
the ITU-T, and uses E.163/E.164 addresses (known more commonly as telephone 
numbers) for addressing.</font></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">
Architecture and context</font></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">The 
PSTN was the earliest example of traffic engineering to deliver Quality of 
Service guarantees. A.K. Erlang (1878-1929) is credited with establishing the 
mathematical foundations of methods required to determine the amount and 
configuration of equipment and personnel required to deliver a specific level of 
service.</font></span><font size="3"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">In the 1970s the 
telecommunications industry conceived that digital services would follow much 
the same pattern as voice services, and conceived a vision of end-to-end circuit 
switched services, known as the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network 
(B-ISDN). The B-ISDN vision has been overtaken by the disruptive technology of 
the Internet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Only the very 
oldest and most backward parts of the telephone network still use analogue 
technology for anything other than the last mile loop to the end user, and in 
recent years digital services have been increasingly rolled out to end users 
using services such as DSL, ISDN and Cable Systems.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Many observers 
believe that the long term future of the PSTN is to be just one application of 
the Internet - however, the Internet has some way to go before this transition 
can be made. The Quality of Service guarantee is one aspect that needs to be 
improved on in the Voice over IP technology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"></font><span style="font-family:Arial">
<font size="3">There are a number of large private telephone networks which are 
not linked to the PSTN, usually for military purposes. There are also private 
networks run by large companies which are linked to the PSTN only through 
limited gateways, like a large private branch exchange system.</font></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="3">
Technology overview</font></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="3">
Although the network was created using analog voice connections through manual 
switchboards, automated telephone exchanges replaced most switchboards, and 
later digital switch technologies were used. Most switches now use digital 
circuits between exchanges, with analog voice used to connect to many 
telephones.</font></span><font size="3"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The basic digital 
circuit in the PSTN is a 64-kilobits-per-second channel, originally designed by 
Bell Labs, called a &quot;DS0&quot; or Digital Signal 0. To carry a typical phone call 
from a calling party to a called party, the audio sound is digitized at an 8 kHz 
sample rate using 8-bit pulse code modulation. The call is then transmitted from 
one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a 
signaling protocol (SS7) between the telephone exchanges under an overall 
routing strategy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The DS0s are the 
basic granularity at which switching takes place in a telephone exchange. DS0s 
are also known as timeslots because they are multiplexed together in a 
time-division fashion. Multiple DS0s are multiplexed together on higher capacity 
circuits, such that 24 DS0s make a DS1 signal, which when carried on copper is 
the well-known, T-carrier system, T1 (the European equivalent is an E1, 
containing 32 64 kbit/s channels). In modern networks, this multiplexing is 
moved as close to the end user as possible, usually into cabinets at the 
roadside in residential areas, or into large business premises.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The timeslots are 
conveyed from the initial multiplexer to the exchange over a set of equipment 
collectively known as the access network. The access network and inter-exchange 
transport of the PSTN use synchronous optical transmission (SONET and SDH) 
technology, although some parts still use the older PDH technology.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"></font><span style="font-family:Arial">
<font size="3">Within the access network, there are a number of reference points 
defined. Most of these are of interest mainly to ISDN but one - the V reference 
point - is of more general interest. This is the reference point between a 
primary multiplexer and an exchange. The protocols at this reference point were 
standardised in ETSI areas as the V5 interface.</font></span>&nbsp;</p>
