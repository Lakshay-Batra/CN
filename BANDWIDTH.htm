<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">
<b>Move <a name="Channels">Channels</a> to Digital<br>
</b>If you do the math, the majority of cable viewers are still watching the 
analog tier. While many premium channels have moved to the digital tier, there 
are other channels that are prime candidates for a move to digital. The quandary 
is how to determine which channels would be the easiest or most advantageous to 
move, create the least disruption for analog customers, yet streamline your 
programming lineup to fit emerging needs for your network and emerging trends in 
viewership. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#336666"><b>The Scientific 
Atlanta Advantage: </b></font>A detailed analysis of viewer habits (something 
you can accomplish with Scientific Atlanta’s Retriever™ Telemetry Diagnostics 
and Viewership Management solution) can help you choose the most logical analog 
channels for relocation onto the digital tier. Operators can typically “recover” 
the bandwidth for two or three channels using this Scientific Atlanta solution, 
and CAPEX is virtually nothing to do this.<br>
<br>
<b>Move from <a name="64">64</a> QAM to 256 QAM<br>
</b><span style="color: black">Operators can pack more channels into existing 
bandwidth by the efficiency delivered by 256 QAMs. Each channel uses about 3.75 
Mbps so you get seven channels out of a 64 QAM and ten from a 256 QAM. An 
important consideration is the ability of deployed set-tops to receive 256 QAM 
signals. </span></font></p>

While some older models of other vendors’ set-tops can only receive 64 QAM 
signals, all Scientific Atlanta</span><sup><span style="color: black">®</span></sup><span style="color: black"> 
Explorer</span><sup><span style="color: black">®</span></sup><span style="color: black"> 
set-tops can receive either 64 or 256 QAM channels. </span><br>
<br>
<b><a name="Dual">Dual</a> Pass Encoding/Closed Loop Encoding<br>
</b><span style="color: black">Dual pass encoding enables you to include more 
than ten channels in the 38.8 Mbps a 256 QAM delivers. Using dual pass encoding 
with closed loop statistical multiplexing, the encoder does a first pass at 
encoding the signal, then it looks ahead and predicts what the bit rate 
requirements of the content will be based on simple, slow static images or 
complex, fast-moving images and encodes it a second time. Determining the 
requirements of the content (rather than assigning it a constant bit rate), 
enables you to often drop channels to 3 Mbps without jeopardizing the video 
quality. </span></font></p>

doing and you have closed loop statistical multiplexing &nbsp;that provides the 
opportunity to send 12-16 channels from a multiplexer to the 256 QAM, optimizing 
the QAM’s contribution.</span><font face="Arial"><br>
<br>
<b><a name="Rate">Tansrating</a></b><br>
After the digital stream has been encoded, an alternative process known as 
transrating or transcoding can be performed at the multiplexer to reduce the 
bandwidth requirement of a group channels, allowing us to move even more 
channels out to the QAM. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><font color="#336666">The Scientific 
Atlanta Advantage: </font></b>We deliver transrating technology using our 
TRANSIS™ RateCompressor technology and a D9600™ Re-multiplexer and Processor. In 
addition to this solution, Scientific Atlanta has announced unprecedented MPEG 
processing capability in a new compact 2RU multiplexer that can simultaneously 
process up to 20x the number of SD or HD MPEG of traditional multiplexers.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="Switched">Switched</a> Digital Video<br>
</b>For decades, analog programming was delivered en masse to consumers with 
cable’s bandwidth filled with programs, some popular and watched by millions, 
some not as popular and rarely seen. As we migrated to both analog and digital 
on the cable plant, then added VOD, data, HD programming and now voice service, 
bandwidth became more packed than ever before. Now, consumers are calling for 
more HD programming and more on-demand options, and bandwidth is maxed out. 
Switched Digital Video (SDV) to the rescue! </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">With SDV, virtually every channel becomes 
an on-demand program since it is quickly delivered to the consumer as it is 
selected in the home, rather than having every channel clogging the broadband 
pipe, most of which are never selected for viewing. This frees large amounts of 
bandwidth for the aforementioned HD and on-demand services. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Providing SDV capability, like nearly 
every facet of video delivery, is a complex process on a complex network. Our 
decades of video delivery experience make Scientific Atlanta a compelling choice 
for adding you in the launch of SDV. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Scientific Atlanta Advantage: 
Scientific Atlanta’s latest advancements with switched digital video is an 
evolutionary step toward next generation architecture. Scientific Atlanta's SDV 
system gives cable operators the flexibility of an open, Internet protocol-based 
(IP-based) SDV system; gigabit quadrature amplitude modulation (GQAM) sharing 
between multiple services and advanced bulk encryption support. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Designed to operate over existing HFC 
infrastructures, Scientific Atlanta's open architecture SDV opens new doors for 
cable operators by enabling the delivery of switched video services on the 
existing installed base of tens of millions MPEG set-tops that cannot decode a 
DOCSIS or Internet protocol (IP) stream. This gives operators a significant 
scale advantage in the introduction of new video services. The new IP-based SDV 
fundamentally changes the model for bandwidth consumption from a linear model 
based on the program offering to one based on program viewership, reclaiming 
some of the bandwidth required for simulcast and advanced interactive services. 
The latest innovations in our open SDV system are designed to help cable 
operators remain competitive in the market. With our IP-based solution, our 
customers can leverage the existing MPEG set-top infrastructure, take advantage 
of open, standard interfaces throughout the network elements, experience 
significant benefits through QAM sharing, and take an important step in the 
evolution toward an IP-based, next generation architecture. Transparent to 
consumers, SDV enables operators to offer an extensive lineup of niche content 
ranging from local and other premium sports packages to ethnic programming, 
leveraging the &quot;long tail&quot; phenomenon in an effort to improve customer 
satisfaction, reduce churn and generate new revenue streams from premium tiers. 
Key differentiators of Scientific Atlanta's SDV system solution are its bulk 
encryption capability, the ability to share QAM bandwidth on a per-stream basis 
between SDV and VOD services within a single RF QAM carrier, and the generation 
of detailed viewership data. QAM sharing reduces overall QAM capacity and RF 
bandwidth requirements and simplifies capacity planning, thereby adding 
bandwidth savings and decreasing both capital and operational expense. With 
detailed viewership data available, cable operators have unprecedented, direct 
access to consumer viewing choices, while maintaining the privacy of individual 
customers. The data can then be used to improve program offerings, maximize the 
return on investment for each program offered and drive targeted ad revenue 
growth.</font></p>
