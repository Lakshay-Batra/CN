<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">Today, LLC is 
only used for its multiplexing feature. Modern Transport Layer protocols, like

network flow management. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial"><br>
A non-IEEE 802 protocol may be distributed between the LLC and Media Access 
Control (MAC) layers, like Cisco’s High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial"><b>In the IEEE 802 reference</b> model of 
computer networking, the logical link control (LLC) data communication protocol 
layer is the upper sublayer of the data link layer (layer 2) of the seven-layer 
OSI model. The LLC sublayer provides multiplexing mechanisms that make it 
possible for several network protocols (IP, IPX, Decnet and Appletalk) to 
coexist within a multipoint network and to be transported over the same network 
medium. It can also provide flow control and automatic repeat request (ARQ) 
error management mechanisms.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The LLC sublayer acts as an interface between 
the media access control (MAC) sublayer and the network layer.</span></span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Operation</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The LLC sublayer is primarily concerned with:</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
<span class="renderedqtext"><span style="font-family: Arial">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Multiplexing protocols transmitted over the MAC layer (when transmitting) and 
decoding them (when receiving).</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
<span class="renderedqtext"><span style="font-family: Arial">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Providing node-to-node flow and error control</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">In today's networks, flow control and error 
management is typically taken care of by a transport layer protocol such as TCP, 
or by some application layer protocol, in an end-to-end fashion, i.e. 
retransmission is done from source to end destination. This implies that the 
need for LLC sublayer flow control and error management has reduced. LLC is 
consequently only a multiplexing feature in today's link layer protocols. An LLC 
header tells the data link layer what to do with a packet once a frame is 
received. It works like this: A host will receive a frame and look in the LLC 
header to find out to what protocol stack the packet is destined - for example, 
the IP protocol at the network layer or IPX. However, today most non-IP network 
protocols are abandoned.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">Application examples</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;X.25 and LAPB</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;An LLC sublayer was a key component in early 
packet switching networks such as X.25 networks with the LAPB data link layer 
protocol, where flow control and error management were carried out in a 
node-to-node fashion, meaning that if an error was detected in a frame, the 
frame was retransmitted from one switch to next instead. This extensive 
handshaking between the nodes made the networks slow.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Local area network (LAN) and metropolitan area 
network (MAN) protocols</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The IEEE 802.2 standard specifies the LLC 
sublayer for all IEEE 802 local area networks, such as IEEE 802.3/Ethernet (if 
the EtherType field is not used), IEEE 802.5, and IEEE 802.11. IEEE 802.2 is 
also used in some non-IEEE 802 networks such as FDDI.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Ethernet</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Since bit errors are very rare in wired 
networks, Ethernet does not provide flow control or automatic repeat request (ARQ), 
meaning that incorrect packets are detected but only cancelled, not 
retransmitted (except in case of collisions detected by the CSMA/CD MAC layer 
protocol). Instead, retransmissions rely on higher layer protocols.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;As the EtherType in an Ethernet frame using 
Ethernet II framing is used to multiplex different protocols on top of the 
Ethernet MAC header it can be seen as an LLC identifier. However, Ethernet 
frames lacking an EtherType have no LLC identifier in the Ethernet header, and, 
instead, use an IEEE 802.2 LLC header after the Ethernet header to provide the 
protocol multiplexing function.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Wireless LAN</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;In wireless communications, bit errors are 
very common. In wireless networks such as IEEE 802.11, flow control and error 
management is part of the CSMA/CA MAC protocol, and not part of the LLC layer. 
The LLC sublayer follows the IEEE 802.2 standard.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;HDLC</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Some non-IEEE 802 protocols can be thought of 
as being split into MAC and LLC layers. For example, while HDLC specifies both 
MAC functions (framing of packets) and LLC functions (protocol multiplexing, 
flow control, detection, and error control through a retransmission of dropped 
packets when indicated), some protocols such as Cisco HDLC can use HDLC-like 
packet framing and their own LLC protocol.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;PPP and modems</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Over telephone network modems, PPP link layer 
protocols can be considered as a LLC protocol, providing multiplexing, but it 
does not provide flow control and error management. In a telephone network, bit 
errors might be common, meaning that error management is crucial, but that is 
today provided by modern protocols. Today's modem protocols have inherited LLC 
features from the older LAPM link layer protocol, made for modem communication 
in old X.25 networks.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Cellular systems</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The GPRS LLC layer also does ciphering and 
deciphering of SN-PDU (SNDCP) packets.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Power lines</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="renderedqtext">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Another example of a data link layer which is 
split between LLC (for flow and error control) and MAC (for multiple access) is 
the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over 
existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).</span></span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial">2) <i>Flow control:</i> LLC specifies the order

physical layer below, the LLC is responsible for looking at the L3 Protocol type 
and handing over the datagram to the correct L3 protocol (de-multiplexing) at 
the network layer above. On the sending side, LLC takes packets from different 
L3 protocols like IP, IPX, ARP etc., and hands it over to the MAC layer after 
filling the L3 protocol type in the LLC header portion of the frame

<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial">LLC can optionally provide reliable frame 
transmission by the sending node numbering each transmitted frame (sequence 
number), the receiving node acknowledging each received frame (acknowledgment 
number) and the sending node retransmitting lost frames. &nbsp;It can also optionally

<span style="font-family:Arial">Based on whether a logical connection is

<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial">a) <strong>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Connectionless 
Unacknowledged Service :</span> </strong>This is a best effort service like IP 
datagram service, with no connection establishment between L2 peers and also no 
acknowledgment for data frames from the peer. Whenever there is data to be 
transferred to the peer, it is sent directly, without any connection 
establishment. Flow control may be optionally provided in this service. In 
Internet, since reliability, flow control and error control are provided at the 
transport layer by TCP, a simple connectionless unacknowledged service is enough 
at the data link layer, provided the link is of good quality with low error 
rates. Hence, this service mode is the most widely used mode in the Internet, 
where TCP/IP is the basic protocol stack. This mode is used on almost all high 
quality wired links like Ethernet and Optical.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Connectionless 
Acknowledged Service:</span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial"> In this 
mode, data is directly sent between Layer2 peers without any logical link 
establishment. But each frame is numbered using sequence numbers and the peer 
acknowledges each frame received using an Acknowledgment number field. This 
service mode is used in scenarios where the overhead of a connection 
establishment is costly due to the extra delay involved, but where data 
reliability is needed. The sender can track lost or damaged frames and 
retransmit such frames to achieve reliability. This type of service is used in 
wireless links, where the quality of link is not as good as wired links and so 
frequent link establishment and teardown are unnecessary overheads, as these 
control frames may themselves be corrupted or lost.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Connection Oriented 
Service:</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span></strong>
<span style="font-family:Arial">In this mode, procedures are laid out for 
logical link establishment and disconnection. Before data transfer, a logical 
connection is established between peers, before data transfer starts, through 
the exchange of control frames, known as <strong><i>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Supervisory Frames</span></i></strong>. 
The logical connection is closed after the data exchange phase is over. Actual 
data transfer starts &nbsp;after the connection establishment phase and frames 
carrying higher layer data are known as <strong><i>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Information Frames</span></i></strong><b><i>.</i></b> 
A third category of frames, known as Unumbered Acknowledgment frames are used to 
acknowledge received Supervisory frames.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial">In this mode too, there are two variants that

<span style="font-family:Arial">Here, though a logical link is established 
before actual data transfer happens, there is no concept of frames being 
numbered and acknowledged through Sequence number and acknowledgment number 
fields. It is just a best effort service, with reliability left to the higher 
layer protocol. Many WAN protocols like HDLC, PPP, LAPB, LAPD etc. use this mode 
of service.</span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">Here, apart from a logical link being 
established before data transfer happens, reliability and flow control services 
are also provided by the LLC. Reliability is provided through the use of 
sequence number, acknowledgment number and retransmission of lost frames using 
strategies like <strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Go 
Back N</span></strong> or <strong>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Selective Repeat</span></strong><b>.
</b><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">Flow control</span></strong> 
is provided by using a <strong>
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: normal">sliding window mechanism</span></strong><b>.

<span style="font-family:Arial">Collision Resolution:</span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
On shared or broadcast links, where multiple end nodes are connected to the same 
link, there has to be a collision resolution protocol running on each node, so 
that the link is used cooperatively. The MAC sub-layer is responsible for this 
task and it is the MAC sub-block that implements standard collision resolution 
protocols like CSMA/CD, CSMA etc. For half-duplex links, it is the MAC sub-layer 
that makes sure that a node sends data on the link only during its turn. <em>For 
full-duplex point-to-point links, the collision resolution functionality of MAC 
sub-layer is not required.</em></span></p>

<span style="font-family:Arial">In end nodes and in intermediate devices like L2 
switches and Routers, the LLC functionality is implemented in <strong>
<span style="font-family: Arial; letter-spacing: .6pt; font-weight: normal">
network device driver software </span></strong>that is part of the Operating 
System&nbsp;and the MAC functionality is implemented in dedicated piece of hardware.</span></p>
