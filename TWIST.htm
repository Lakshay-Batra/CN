<font color="#FF0000" face="Arial" size="6"><u>Twisted-Pair Cable</u></font></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Twisted pair is the ordinary copper wire 
that connects home and many business computers to the telephone company. To 
reduce crosstalk or electromagnetic induction between pairs of wires, two 
insulated copper wires are twisted around each other. Each connection on twisted 
pair requires both wires. Since some telephone sets or desktop locations require 
multiple connections, twisted pair is sometimes installed in two or more pairs, 
all within a single cable. For some business locations, twisted pair is enclosed 
in a shield that functions as a ground. This is known as shielded twisted pair 
(STP). Ordinary wire to the home is unshielded twisted pair (UTP). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Twisted pair is now frequently installed 
with two pairs to the home, with the extra pair making it possible for you to 
add another line (perhaps for modem use) when you need it. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Twisted pair comes with each pair uniquely 
color coded when it is packaged in multiple pairs. Different uses such as 
analog, digital, and Ethernet require different pair multiples. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Although twisted pair is often associated 
with home use, a higher grade of twisted pair is often used for horizontal 
wiring in LAN installations because it is less expensive than coaxial cable.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The wire you buy at a local hardware store 
for extensions from your phone or computer modem to a wall jack is not twisted 
pair. It is a side-by-side wire known as <i>silver satin</i>. The wall jack can 
have as many five kinds of hole arrangements or pinouts, depending on the kinds 
of wire the installation expects will be plugged in (for example, digital, 
analog, or LAN) . (That's why you may sometimes find when you carry your 
notebook computer to another location that the wall jack connections won't match 
your plug.) </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Twisted-pair cable</i></b> is a type 
of cabling that is used for telephone communications and most modern Ethernet 
networks. A pair of wires forms a circuit that can transmit data. The pairs are 
twisted to provide protection against <i>crosstalk</i>, the noise generated by 
adjacent pairs. When electrical current flows through a wire, it creates a 
small, circular magnetic field around the wire. When two wires in an electrical 
circuit are placed close together, their magnetic fields are the exact opposite 
of each other. Thus, the two magnetic fields cancel each other out. They also 
cancel out any outside magnetic fields. Twisting the wires can enhance this <i>
cancellation effect</i>. Using cancellation together with twisting the wires, 
cable designers can effectively provide self-shielding for wire pairs within the 
network media. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Two basic types of twisted-pair cable 
exist: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP). The 
following sections discuss UTP and STP cable in more detail. </font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">UTP Cable </font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">UTP cable is a medium that is composed of 
pairs of wires <b>&nbsp;</b>UTP cable is used in a variety of networks. Each of 
the eight individual copper wires in UTP cable \is covered by an insulating 
material. In addition, the wires in each pair are twisted around each other.
</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>
<a href="javascript:popUp('/content/images/chap08_1587051079/elementLinks/08fig01.gif')">

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cable</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">UTP cable relies solely on the 
cancellation effect produced by the twisted wire pairs to limit signal 
degradation caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency 
interference (RFI). To further reduce crosstalk between the pairs in UTP cable, 
the number of twists in the wire pairs varies. UTP cable must follow precise 
specifications governing how many twists or braids are permitted per meter (3.28 
feet) of cable.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">UTP cable often is installed using a 
Registered Jack 45 (RJ-45) connector . The RJ-45 is an eight-wire connector used 
commonly to connect computers onto a local-area network (LAN), especially 
Ethernets. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>

</a>RJ-45 Connectors</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When used as a networking medium, UTP 
cable has four pairs of either 22- or 24-gauge copper wire. UTP used as a 
networking medium has an impedance of 100 ohms; this differentiates it from 
other types of twisted-pair wiring such as that used for telephone wiring, which 
has impedance of 600 ohms. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">UTP cable offers many advantages. Because 
UTP has an external diameter of approximately 0.43 cm (0.17 inches), its small 
size can be advantageous during installation. Because it has such a small 
external diameter, UTP does not fill up wiring ducts as rapidly as other types 
of cable. This can be an extremely important factor to consider, particularly 
when installing a network in an older building. UTP cable is easy to install and 
is less expensive than other types of networking media. In fact, UTP costs less 
per meter than any other type of LAN cabling. And because UTP can be used with 
most of the major networking architectures, it continues to grow in popularity.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Disadvantages also are involved in using 
twisted-pair cabling, however. UTP cable is more prone to electrical noise and 
interference than other types of networking media, and the distance between 
signal boosts is shorter for UTP than it is for coaxial and fiber-optic cables.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Although UTP was once considered to be 
slower at transmitting data than other types of cable, this is no longer true. 
In fact, UTP is considered the fastest copper-based medium today. The following 
summarizes the features of UTP cable:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Speed and throughput—10 to 1000 Mbps</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Average cost per node—Least expensive</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Media and connector size—Small</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Maximum cable length—100 m (short)</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Commonly used types of UTP cabling are as 
follows:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Category 1</b>—Used for telephone 
  communications. Not suitable for transmitting data.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Category 2</b>—Capable of 
  transmitting data at speeds up to 4 megabits per second (Mbps).</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Category 3</b>—Used in 10BASE-T 
  networks. Can transmit data at speeds up to 10 Mbps.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Category 4</b>—Used in Token Ring 
  networks. Can transmit data at speeds up to 16 Mbps.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Category 5</b>—Can transmit data at 
  speeds up to 100 Mbps.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Category 5e </b>—Used in networks 
  running at speeds up to 1000 Mbps (1 gigabit per second [Gbps]).</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Category 6</b>—Typically, Category 6 
  cable consists of four pairs of 24 American Wire Gauge (AWG) copper wires. 
  Category 6 cable is currently the fastest standard for UTP. </font></li>
</ul>
<h3 align="justify"><font size="3" face="Arial">Shielded Twisted-Pair Cable
</font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>Shielded twisted-pair (STP)</i> cable 
combines the techniques of shielding, cancellation, and wire twisting. Each pair 
of wires is wrapped in a metallic foil ( The four pairs of wires then are 
wrapped in an overall metallic braid or foil, usually 150-ohm cable. As 
specified for use in Ethernet network installations, STP reduces electrical 
noise both within the cable (pair-to-pair coupling, or crosstalk) and from 
outside the cable (EMI and RFI). STP usually is installed with STP data 
connector, which is created especially for the STP cable. However, STP cabling 
also can use the same RJ connectors that UTP uses.</font></p>

Shielded Twisted-Pair Cable </b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Although STP prevents interference better 
than UTP, it is more expensive and difficult to install. In addition, the 
metallic shielding must be grounded at both ends. If it is improperly grounded, 
the shield acts like an antenna and picks up unwanted signals. Because of its 
cost and difficulty with termination, STP is rarely used in Ethernet networks. 
STP is primarily used in Europe. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The following summarizes the features of 
STP cable:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Speed and throughput—10 to 100 Mbps</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Average cost per node—Moderately 
  expensive</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Media and connector size—Medium to large</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Maximum cable length—100 m (short)</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When comparing UTP and STP, keep the 
following points in mind:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The speed of both types of cable is 
  usually satisfactory for local-area distances.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">These are the least-expensive media for 
  data communication. UTP is less expensive than STP.</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Because most buildings are already wired 
  with UTP, many transmission standards are adapted to use it, to avoid costly 
  rewiring with an alternative cable type.</font></li>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">UTP vs STP</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Twisted pair 
cables are widely used in transmitting information, especially across great 
distances. The twist in the wire cancels out any magnetic interference that may 
develop in the wiring. There are two common types of twisted pair cabling, STP 
and UTP. The S stands for Shielded, the U stands for Unshielded, and the TP 
stands for twisted pair for both. STP simply has additional shielding material 
that is used to cancel any external interference that may be introduced at any 
point in the path of the cable. UTP cables have no protection against such 
interference and its performance is often degraded in its presence. Using STP 
cables ensure that you get the maximum bandwidth from your cabling even if the 
external condition is less than ideal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The biggest 
drawback to using STP cables is the higher cost. The shielding is an additional 
material that goes into every meter of the cable, thereby raising its total 
cost. The shielding also makes the cable heavier and a bit more difficult to 
bend or manipulate in any way. This is not a big issue but something that users 
should know when choosing between STP and UTP.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">In terms of usage, 
UTP is the more prevalent and popular cabling that is used in most homes, 
offices, and even in large scale businesses due to its lower cost. STP is 
commonly used by large scale companies in high-end applications that require the 
maximum bandwidth. STP cables are also used in outdoor environments where the 
cables are exposed to the elements and manmade structures and equipment that may 
introduce additional interference. Good examples of this would be the 
telephone/internet cables that run from your home, to the junction box, down to 
the establishments of your provider or ISP.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">For most common 
uses, it does not really matter whether you use STP or UTP as both would 
probably perform well. UTP is the more logical choice as it is cheaper and much 
easier to find in the majority of computer equipment retailers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">Recently, the advantages and disadvantages of shielded and 
unshielded twisted-pair cable have been under debate. Advocates of STP cable, 
which includes screened twisted-pair and foil twisted-pair cables, claim that it 
is superior to UTP cable. However, these advocates have not presented the other 
side of the story.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">STP and UTP cable differ in design and manufacture. But their 
purpose should be the same--to provide reliable connectivity of electronic 
equipment. In theory, both types of cable should do this equally well. The true 
test comes when you look at how each of these cable types performs that task 
within its respective end-to-end system.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: 700">Shielded 
twisted-pair cable</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">Shielded twisted-pair cable encases the signal-carrying wires in a 
conducting shield as a means of reducing the potential for electromagnetic 
interference. How effective the shielding is depends on the material used for 
the shield--its thickness and frequency, the type of electromagnetic noise 
field, the distance from the noise source to the shield, any shield 
discontinuity and the grounding practices. Also, crosstalk and signal noise can 
increase if the effects of the shield are not compensated for.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">Some STP cables, for example, use a thick braided shield that makes 
a cable heavier, thicker and more difficult to install than its UTP counterpart. 
Other STP cables use only a thin outer foil shield. These cables, known as 
screened twisted-pair cables or foil twisted-pair cables, are thinner and less 
expensive than braided STP cable; however, they are not any easier to install. 
Unless the minimum bend radius and maximum pulling tension are rigidly observed 
when these cables are installed, the shield can be torn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-weight: 700">Unshielded 
twisted-pair cable</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">Unshielded twisted-pair cable does not rely on physical shielding 
to block interference. It relies instead on balancing and filtering techniques 
using media filters, baluns or both. Noise is induced equally on two conductors 
and is canceled out at the receiver. With properly designed, manufactured and 
installed UTP cable, the network is easier to maintain than one in an STP cable 
plant, with its shielding continuity and grounding issues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">UTP cable has evolved during the years, and different types are 
available for different needs. Basic telephone cable, also known as 
direct-inside wire, is still available. Improvements over the years--variations 
in the twists or in individual wire sheaths or overall cable jackets--have led 
to the development of Category 3 cable that is compliant with the Electronic 
Industries Association/ Telecommunications Industry Association-568 standard for 
transmission rates up to 16 megahertz. Category 4 UTP cable is specified for 
signal bandwidths to 20 MHz, and Category 5 UTP for specifications to 100 
MHz--and possibly higher.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">Because UTP cable is lightweight, thin and flexible, as well as 
versatile, reliable and inexpensive, millions of nodes have been, and continue 
to be, wired with this cabling medium. This is especially true for 
high-data-rate applications. For best performance, this UTP cable should be used 
as part of a well-engineered structured cabling system.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">If STP cable is combined with improperly shielded connectors, 
connecting hardware or outlets, or if the foil shield itself is damaged, overall 
signal quality will be degraded. This, in turn, can result in degraded emission 
and immunity performance. Therefore, for a shielded cabling system to totally 
reduce interference, every component within that system must be fully and 
seamlessly shielded, as well as properly installed and maintained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">An STP cabling system also requires good grounding and earthing 
practices because of the presence of the shield. An improperly grounded system 
can be a primary source of emissions and interference. Whether this ground is at 
one end or both ends of the cable run depends on the frequency at which a given 
application is running. For high-frequency signals, an STP cabling system must 
be grounded, at minimum, at both ends of the cable run, and it must be 
continuous. A shield grounded at only one end is not effective against 
magnetic-field interference.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">The length of the ground conductor itself can also cause problems. 
If it is too long, it no longer acts as a ground. Therefore, because specific 
grounding requirements depend on the application, a general grounding policy 
that ensures the best results for an STP cabling system is not possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">UTP cabling systems do not have this problem. While an STP cabling 
system is dependent on such factors as physical continuity of the cable shield 
or installation with adequately shielded and grounded components, a UTP cabling 
system inherently has fewer potential trouble spots and is easier to install.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">Another factor to consider when you are choosing a cabling system, 
in addition to precision design and manufacture and end-to-end integrity, is 
electromagnetic compatibility. EMC refers to the ability of an electronic system 
to function properly in its environment--that is, in an environment where 
several pieces of equipment are located in the same workspace, each radiating 
electromagnetic emissions. With more and more electronic equipment in the 
average workspace, EMC becomes increasingly important. Excess radiation from one 
piece of equipment can adversely affect performance of other devices. In some 
countries, including the United States and Germany, EMC regulations have existed 
for years. However, the implementation of the European EMC Directive in 1989 has 
refocused attention on this problem. This directive, also known as 
89/336/European Economic Community, states that all electronic equipment and 
apparatus (that is, electronic systems) must comply with the directive, and that 
systems using this equipment and apparatus must pass the essential requirements 
of the directive before they can be sold anywhere in the EEC.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">Some national regulations, such as Amtsblatt Verfugung 243/91 of 
Germany, currently exempt STP-based systems from immunity testing. However, as 
of January 1, 1996, these national regulations will no longer apply, and all 
systems will have to be tested. Those that do not pass will not be able to be 
sold in the EEC. This means that every electronic system that includes either an 
STP or a UTP cabling system must meet this ECC directive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">How well do UTP- and STP-based systems stand up to rigorous EMC 
testing? Contrary to popular assumption, not all STP-based systems can 
automatically pass EMC tests, while a well-designed UTP cabling system can.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">EMC Fribourg, a Swiss testing facility, conducted comparative EMC 
tests on four STP cabling systems and one UTP cabling system. All were 
configured to support the IBM 16-megabit-per-second Token Ring local area 
network applications, in accordance with ISO-8802.5 standards, and using 
personal computers with IBM Token Ring adapter cards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">According to EMC Fribourg, the test results showed that in radiated 
emissions testing for a frequency range of 30 MHz to 1 gigahertz in an anaechoic 
chamber (a test facility that eliminates outside electrical sources) and in an 
open-area test site, the UTP system more than adequately met the International 
Special Committee on Radio Interference, or CISPR, 22/EN5022 Class B 
requirements. Class B requirements are for residential use and are more 
stringent than the Class A requirements for commercial use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">In conducting emissions on signal-port testing at lower frequencies 
(150 kilohertz to 30 MHz) with a current probe, the UTP system met the proposed 
CISPR 22/EN55022 Class B requirements. In International Electrotechnical 
Commission-801.4 electrical fast transient noise-burst testing, the UTP system 
did not fail even when subjected to the most strenuous test at 4000 volts. None 
of the STP cabling systems survived to that level. In IEC-801.3 radiated 
immunity testing, which evaluates the ability of a system to withstand 
electromagnetic interference at defined severity levels (26 MHz to 1 GHz), the 
UTP system experienced no errors. The test laboratory concluded that UTP cabling 
systems can meet the stated EMC requirements.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">Additional testing indicates that UTP cabling systems can meet 
standards specifications for transmitting high-speed data within acceptable 
levels and can pass all required EMC tests. In this case, EMC tests were 
conducted on an ISO-8802.3 10 Mbits/sec 10Base-T system and ISO-9314 (American 
National Standards Institute X3T9.5) 100-Mbit/sec twisted-pair/physical 
medium-dependent local area network that used Systimax SCS 1061 Category 5, 
24-AWG, high-performance, four-pair UTP cable, with Category 5 patch panels, 
Category 5 M100-type input/output devices and Category 5 patch cords, along with 
486-type PCs and electronics from several major vendors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:top">
<span style="font-family:Arial;
color:black">The tests were conducted at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories Global Product 
Compliance Laboratory (Holmdel, NJ) and were sent for certification to the 
Bundesamt fur Zulassungen in der Telecommunication, a German organization. The 
UTP cabling system passed every test, including radiated emissions, conducted 
emissions, electrostatic discharge immunity, radiated field immunity and 
Electrical Fast Transient/burst immunity.</span></p>
