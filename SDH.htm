<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) is a 
standard technology for synchronous data transmission on optical media. It is 
the international equivalent of
<term>Synchronous Optical Network</term>. Both technologies provide faster and 
less expensive network interconnection than traditional PDH (Plesiochronous 
Digital Hierarchy) equipment. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In digital telephone transmission, 
&quot;synchronous&quot; means the bits from one call are carried within one transmission 
frame. &quot;Plesiochronous&quot; means &quot;almost (but not) synchronous,&quot; or a call that 
must be extracted from more than one transmission frame. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">SDH uses the following Synchronous 
Transport Modules (STM) and rates: STM-1 (155 megabits per second), STM-4 (622 
Mbps), STM-16 (2.5 gigabits per second), and STM-64 (10 Gbps).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 21.6pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">The <b>Transmission System</b> is traditionally 
seen as the link between main WAN switching centres. These Transmission Systems 
consist of large bandwidth highways that form the backbone to the network. They 
typically serve many customers each with their own requirements so the systems 
have to be reliable, resilient and flexible. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 21.6pt" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial">Rather 
than have two wires for every voice or data conversation, <b>Time Division 
Multiplexing</b> is used. ITU-T G.704 defines 32 channels of 64Kb/s to form 
2.048Mb/s where channel 0 is used for framing. You will often see the standard 
G.703 mentioned with G.704, this is because G.703 defines the unframed physical 
interface coaxial (75 ohm) or RJ48 (120 ohm) used for the E1/T1 connection at 
the client premises. Channel 0 is for timing used to synchronise the 
multiplexers at each end of the link. Channels 1 to 15 and 17 to 31 are for 
voice or data whilst channel 16 is used for <b>Common Channel Signalling (CCS)</b> 
or <b>Channel Associated Signalling (CAS)</b>. Every 3.91 microseconds 8 bits 
from one channel is sent down the line followed by 8 bits from the next channel 
during the next 3.91 microseconds and so on in a round robin fashion throughout 
all the channels, thus 32 channels are used once every 125 microseconds. The 
connection at the end is either a 75 ohm coax, 120 ohm coax or a 150 ohm UTP/STP.

<span style="font-family: Arial">As bandwidth demand grew the technology called
<b>Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH)</b> was developed by ITU-T G.702, 
whereby the basic primary multiplexer 2.048Mb/s trunks were joined together by 
adding bits (bit stuffing) which synchronised the trunks at each level of the 
PDH. 2.048Mb/s was called <b>E1</b> and the hierarchy is based on multiples of 4 
E1s. </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial">The E3 tributaries are faster than the E2 
tributaries, E2 tributaries are faster than the E1 tributaries and so on. These 
need to be synchronised with other tributaries, so extra bits are added called
<b>Justification bits</b>. These tell the multiplexers which bits are data and 
which are spare. Multiplexers on the same level of the hierarchy remove the 
spare bits and are synchronised with each other at that level only. Multiplexers 
on one level operate on a different timing from multiplxers on another level. 
For instance, the timing between Primary Rate Muxes (combines 30 x 64Kb/s 
channels into 2.048Mb/s E1) will be different from the timing between 8Mbit 
muxes (combines up to 4 x 2Mb/s into 8Mb/s). </span></p>

<h2 align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Overview</font></b></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The use of synchronous digital 
transmission by PTOs in their backbone fibre-optic and radio network will put in 
place the enabling technology that will support many new broad-band data 
services demanded by the new breed of computer user. However, the deployment of 
synchronous digital transmission is not only concerned with the provision of 
high-speed gigabit networks. It has as much to do with simplifying access to 
links and with bringing the full benefits of software control in the form of 
flexibility and introduction of network management. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In many respects, the benefits to the PTO 
will be the same as those brought to the electronics industry when hard wired 
logic was replaced by the microprocessor. As with that revolution, synchronous 
digital transmission will not take hold overnight, but deployment will be spread 
over a decade, with the technology first appearing on new backbone links. The 
first to feel the benefits will be the PTOs themselves, as demonstrated by the 
technology's early uptake by many operators including BT. Only later will 
customers directly benefit with the introduction of new services such as 
connectionless LAN-to-LAN transmission capability. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">According to one market research company 
it will take until the mid or late 1990s before 70% of revenue for network 
equipment manufacturers will be derived from synchronous systems. Remembering 
that this is a multi-billion $ market, this constitutes a radical change by any 
standard (Figure 2). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Users who extensively use PCs and 
workstations with LANs, graphic layout, CAD and remote database applications are 
now looking to the telecommunication service suppliers to provide the means of 
interlinking these now powerful machines at data rates commensurable with those 
achieved by their own in-house LANs. They also want to be able to transfer 
information to other metropolitan and international sites as easily and as 
quickly as they can to a colleague sitting at the next desk. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Digital data and voice transmission is 
based on a 2.048Mbit/s bearer consisting of 30 time division multiplexed (TDM) 
voice channels, each running at 64Kbps (known as E1 and described by the CCITT 
G.703 specification). At the E1 level, timing is controlled to an accuracy of 1 
in 1011 by synchronising to a master Caesium clock. Increasing traffic over the 
past decade has demanded that more and more of these basic E1 bearers be 
multiplexed together to provide increased capacity. During this time rates have 
increased through 8, 34, and 140Mbit/s. The highest capacity commonly 
encountered today for inter-city fibre optic links is 565Mbit/s, with each link 
carrying 7,680 base channels, and now even this is insufficient. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Unlike E1 2.048Mbit/s bearers, higher rate 
bearers in the hierarchy are operated plesiochronously, with tolerances on an 
absolute bit-rate ranging from 30ppm (parts per million) at 8Mbit/s to 15ppm at 
140Mbit/s. Multiplexing such bearers (known as <i>tributaries </i>in SDH speak) 
to a higher aggregate rate (e.g. 4 x 8Mbit/s to 1 x 34Mbit/s) requires the 
padding of each tributary by adding bits such that their combined rate together 
with the addition of control bits matches the final aggregate rate. 
Plesiochronous transmission is now often referred to as plesiochronous digital 
hierarchy (PDH). </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><i>Figure 3 - A typical Plesiochronous Drop 
&amp; Insert</i> </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Because of the large investment in earlier 
generations of plesiochronous transmission equipment, each step increase in 
capacity has necessitated maintaining compatibility with what was already 
installed by adding yet another layer of multiplexing. This has created the 
situation where each data link has a rigid physical and electrical multiplexing 
hierarchy at either end. Once multiplexed, there is no simple way an individual 
E1 bearer can be identified in a PDH hierarchy, let alone extracted, without 
fully demultiplexing down to the E1 level again as shown in Figure 3. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The limitations of PDS multiplexing are:
</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A hierarchy of multiplexers at either 
  end of the link can lead to reduced reliability and resilience, minimum 
  flexibility, long reconfiguration turn-around times, large equipment volume, 
  and high capital-equipment and maintenance costs. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">PDH links are generally limited to 
  point-to-point configurations with full demultiplexing at each switching or 
  cross connect node. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Incompatibilities at the optical 
  interfaces of two different suppliers can cause major system integration 
  problems. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">To add or drop an <i>individual</i> 
  channel or add a lower rate branch to a backbone link a complete hierarchy of 
  MUXs is required as shown in figure 3. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Because of these limitations of PDH, the 
  introduction of an acceptable world-wide synchronous transmission standard 
  called SDH is welcomed by all. </font></li>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the USA in the early 1980s, it was 
clear that a new standard was required to overcome the limitations presented by 
PDH networks, so the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) SONET 
(synchronous optical network) standard was born in 1984. By 1988, collaboration 
between ANSI and CCITT produced an international standard, a superset of SONET, 
called synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">US SONET standards are based on STS-1 
(synchronous transport signal) equivalent to 51.84Mbit/s. When encoded and 
modulated onto a fibre optic carrier STS-1 is known as OC-1. This particular 
rate was chosen to accommodate a US T-3 plesiochronous payload to maintain 
backwards compatibility with PDH. Higher data rates are multiples of this up to 
STS-48, which is 2,488Gbit/s. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">SDH is based on an STM-1 (155.52Mbit/s) 
rate, which is identical to the SONET STS-3 rate. Some higher bearer rates 
coincide with SONET rates such as: STS-12 and STM-4 = 622Mbit/s, and STS-48 and 
STM-16 = 2.488Gbit/s. Mercury is currently trialing STM-1 and STM-16 rate 
equipment. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">SDH supports the transmission of all PDH 
payloads, other than 8Mbit/s, and ATM, SMDS and MAN data. Most importantly, 
because each type of payload is transmitted in <i>containers</i> synchronous 
with the STM-1 frame, selected payloads may be inserted or extracted from the 
STM-1 or STM-N aggregate without the need to fully hierarchically de-multiplex 
as with PDH systems. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Further, all SDH equipment is software 
controlled, even down to the individual chip, allowing centralised management of 
the network configuration, and largely obviates the need for plugs and sockets. 
A future SDH network could look like Figure 4. </font></p>

<h2 align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Benefits of SDH Transmission</font></b></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">SDH transmission systems have many 
benefits over PDH: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Software Control </b>allows extensive 
  use of intelligent network management software for high flexibility, fast and 
  easy re-configurability, and efficient network management. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Survivability.</b> With SDH, ring 
  networks become practicable and their use enables automatic reconfiguration 
  and traffic rerouting when a link is damaged. End-to-end monitoring will allow 
  full management and maintenance of the whole network. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Efficient drop and insert. </b>SDH 
  allows simple and efficient cross-connect without full hierarchical 
  multiplexing or de-multiplexing. A single E1 2.048Mbit/s tail can be dropped 
  or inserted with relative ease even on Gbit/s links. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Standardisation</b> enables the 
  interconnection of equipment from different suppliers through support of 
  common digital and optical standards and interfaces. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Robustness and resilience</b> of 
  installed networks is increased. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Equipment size and operating costs</b> 
  are reduced by removing the need for banks of multiplexers and 
  de-multiplexers. Follow-on maintenance costs are also reduced. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Backwards compatibly</b> will enable 
  SDH links to support PDH traffic. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Future proof. </b>SDH forms the 
  basis, in partnership with ATM (asynchronous transfer mode), of broad-band 
  transmission, otherwise known as B-ISDN or the precursor of this service in 
  the form of Switched Multimegabit Data Service, (SMDS). </font></li>
</ul>
<h2 align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Conclusions</font></b></h2>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The introduction of synchronous digital 
transmission in the form of SDH will eventually revolutionise all aspects of 
public data communication from individual leased lines through to trunk 
networks. Because of the state-of-the-art nature of SDH and SONET technology, 
there are extensive field trials taking place in 1992 throughout the world prior 
to introduction in the 1993 - 1995 time scale. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There is still a lack of understanding of 
the ramifications of the introduction of SDH within telecommunications 
operations. In practice, the use of extensive software control will impact 
positively all parts of the business. It is not so much a question of <i>whether</i> 
the technology will be taken up, but when. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Introduction of SDH will lead to the 
availability of many new broad-band data services providing users with increased 
flexibility. It is in this area where confusion reigns with potential 
technologies vying for supremacy. These will be discussed in future issues of 
Technology Watch. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Importantly for PTOs, SDH will bring about 
more competition between equipment suppliers designing essentially to a common 
standard. One practical effect could be to force equipment prices down, brought 
about by the larger volumes engendered by access to world rather than local 
markets. At least one manufacturer is currently stating that they will be 
spending up to 80% of their SDH development budgets on management software 
rather than hardware. Such was the situation in the computer industry in the 
early 1980s. Not least, it will have a great impact on such issues as staffing 
levels and required personal skills of personnel within PTOs. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">SDH deployment will take a great deal of 
investment and effort since it replaces the very infrastructure of the world's 
core communications networks. But it must not be forgotten that there are still 
many issues to be resolved. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The benefits to be gained in terms of 
improving operator profitability, and helping them to compete in the new markets 
of the 1990s, are so high that deployment of SDH is just a question of time.
