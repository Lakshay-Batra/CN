<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In 1985, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic 
Engineers (IEEE) in the United States of America, produced a series of standards 
for
Local Area Networks (LANs) called the IEEE 802 standards. These have found 
widespread acceptability and now form the core of most LANs. One of the IEEE 802 
standards, IEEE 802.3, is a standard known as &quot;Ethernet&quot;. This is the most 
widely used LAN technology in the world today. Ethernet was developed by the 
Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Centre (known colloquially as Xerox PARC) 
in 1972 and was probably the first true LAN to be introduced. Although IEEE 
802.3 differs somewhat from the original standard (the &quot;blue 
book&quot; defined in September 1980) it is very similar, and both sets of 
standards may be used with the same LAN.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The IEEE standards have been adopted vy the International 
Standards Organization (ISO), and is standardized in a series of standards known 
as ISO 8802-3. ISO was created in 1947 to construct world-wide standards for a 
wide variety of Engineering tasks. Adoption of ISO standards allows 
manufacturers to produce equipment which is guarented to operate anywhere it is 
finally used. ISO standards tend to be based on other standards (such as those 
produced by the IEEE), the only problem is that the ISO standards tend to be 
issued later, and are therefore less up to date.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The simplest form of Ethernet uses a passive bus operated 
at 10 Mbps. The bus is formed from a 50 Ohm co-axial cable which connects all 
the computers in the LAN. A single LAN may have up to 1024 attached systems, 
although in practice most LANs have far fewer. One or more pieces of coaxial 
cable are joined end to end to create the bus, known as an &quot;Ethernet Cable 
Segment&quot;. Each segment is terminated at both ends by 50 Ohm resistors (to 
prevent reflections from the discontinuity at the end of the cable) and is also 
normally earthed at one end (for electrical safety). Computers may attach to the 
cable using
transceivers and
network interface cards.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Frames of data are formed 
using a protocol called Medium Access Control (MAC), and encoded using 
Manchester line encoding. Ethernet uses a simple Carrier-Sense Multiple Access 
protocol with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to prevent two computers trying to 
transmit at the same time (or more correctly to ensure both computers retransmit 
any frames which are corrupted by simultaneous transmission).</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Ethernet LANs may be 
implemented using a variety of media (not just the coaxial cable described 
above). The types of media segments supported by Ethernet are:</span></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There is also a version of Ethernet which operates using 
twisted pair cabling or fibre optic links at 100 Mbps and at 1 Gbps. 100 Mbps 
networks may operate full duplex (using a Fast
Ethernet Switch) or half duplex (using a Fast
Ethernet Hub). 1 Gbps networks usually operate between a pair of Ethernet 
Switches. Many LANs combine the various speeds of operation using dual-speed 
switches which allow the same switch to connect some ports to one speed of 
network, and other ports at another speed. The higher speed ports are usually 
used to connect switches to one another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">(N.B. It is not possible to have a dual-speed hub, since a 
hub does not store and forward frames, however a number of manufacturers sell 
products they call &quot;dual-speed hubs&quot;. In fact, such devices contain both a 10 
Mbps and a 100 Mbps hubs, interconnected by a store-and-forward bridge.)</font></p>
