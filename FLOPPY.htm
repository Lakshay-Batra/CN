<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Basically, a floppy disk drive reads and 
writes data to a small, circular piece of metal-coated plastic similar to audio 
cassette tape. In this article, you will learn more about what is inside a 
floppy disk drive and how it works. You will also find out some cool facts about 
FDDs.</font></p>
<h1 class="articlePageTitle" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">History 
of the </font></h1>
<!-- dtl_id=24927 //-->
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The floppy disk drive (<b>FDD</b>) was 
invented at IBM by Alan Shugart in 1967. The first floppy drives used an 8-inch 
disk (later called a &quot;<b>diskette</b>&quot; as it got smaller), which evolved into 
the 5.25-inch disk that was used on the first IBM Personal Computer in August 
1981. The 5.25-inch disk held 360 kilobytes compared to the 1.44 megabyte 
capacity of today's 3.5-inch diskette. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The 5.25-inch disks were dubbed &quot;<b>floppy</b>&quot; 
because the diskette packaging was a very <b>flexible plastic envelope</b>, 
unlike the rigid case used to hold today's 3.5-inch diskettes. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">By the mid-1980s, the improved designs of 
the read/write heads, along with improvements in the magnetic recording media, 
led to the less-flexible, 3.5-inch, 1.44-megabyte (MB) capacity FDD in use 
today. For a few years, computers had both FDD sizes (3.5-inch and 5.25-inch). 
But by the mid-1990s, the 5.25-inch version had fallen out of popularity, partly 
because the diskette's recording surface could easily become contaminated by 
fingerprints through the open access area. </font></p>

of a Floppy Disk Drive</font></h1>
<!-- dtl_id=24929 //-->
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000099">The Disk</font><br>
A floppy disk is a lot like a cassette tape: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Both use a thin plastic base material 
  coated with iron oxide. This oxide is a <b>ferromagnetic</b> material, meaning 
  that if you expose it to a magnetic field it is permanently magnetized by the 
  field. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Both can record information instantly.
  </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Both can be erased and reused many 
  times. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Both are very inexpensive and easy to 
  use. </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you have ever used an audio cassette, 
you know that it has one big disadvantage -- it is a <b>sequential</b> device. 
The tape has a beginning and an end, and to move the tape to another song later 
in the sequence of songs on the tape you have to use the fast forward and rewind 
buttons to find the start of the song, since the tape heads are stationary. For 
a long audio cassette tape it can take a minute or two to rewind the whole tape, 
making it hard to find a song in the middle of the tape. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A floppy disk, like a cassette tape, is 
made from a thin piece of plastic coated with a magnetic material on both sides. 
However, it is shaped like a disk rather than a long thin ribbon. The tracks are 
arranged in <b>concentric rings</b> so that the software can jump from &quot;file 1&quot; 
to &quot;file 19&quot; without having to fast forward through files 2-18. The diskette 
spins like a record and the heads move to the correct track, providing what is 
known as <b>direct access storage</b>. </font></p>

  diskette. The common size is 3.5 inches. </font></li>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Floppy disk drive</b> - The

<b>In the illustration above, you can see how the disk is divided into tracks 
(brown) and sectors (yellow). </b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#000099">The Drive</font><br>
The major parts of a FDD include: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Read/Write Heads</b>: Located on both 
  sides of a diskette, they move together on the same assembly. The heads are 
  not directly opposite each other in an effort to prevent interaction between 
  write operations on each of the two media surfaces. The same head is used for 
  reading and writing, while a second, wider head is used for erasing a track 
  just prior to it being written. This allows the data to be written on a wider 
  &quot;clean slate,&quot; without interfering with the analog data on an adjacent track.
  </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Drive Motor</b>: A very small spindle 
  motor engages the metal hub at the center of the diskette, spinning it at 
  either 300 or 360 rotations per minute (RPM). </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Stepper Motor</b>: This motor makes a 
  precise number of stepped revolutions to move the read/write head assembly to 
  the proper track position. The read/write head assembly is fastened to the 
  stepper motor shaft. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Mechanical Frame</b>: A system of 
  levers that opens the little protective window on the diskette to allow the 
  read/write heads to touch the dual-sided diskette media. An external button 
  allows the diskette to be ejected, at which point the spring-loaded protective 
  window on the diskette closes. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Circuit Board</b>: Contains all of 
  the electronics to handle the data read from or written to the diskette. It 
  also controls the stepper-motor control circuits used to move the read/write 
  heads to each track, as well as the movement of the read/write heads toward 
  the diskette surface. </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The read/write heads do not touch the 
diskette media when the heads are traveling between tracks. Electronic optics 
check for the presence of an opening in the lower corner of a 3.5-inch diskette 
(or a notch in the side of a 5.25-inch diskette) to see if the user wants to 
prevent data from being written on it. </font></p>

<h1 class="articlePageTitle" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Writing 
Data on a Floppy Disk</font></h1>
<!-- dtl_id=24931 //-->
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The following is an overview of how a 
floppy disk drive writes data to a floppy disk. Reading data is very similar. 
Here's what happens: </font></p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The computer program passes an <b>
  instruction</b> to the computer hardware to write a data file on a floppy 
  disk, which is very similar to a single platter in a hard disk drive except 
  that it is spinning much slower, with far less capacity and slower access 
  time. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The computer hardware and the 
  floppy-disk-drive controller start the <b>motor</b> in the diskette drive to
  <b>spin the floppy disk</b>. The disk has many concentric tracks on 
  each side. Each track is divided into smaller segments called sectors, like 
  slices of a pie. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A second motor, called a <b>stepper 
  motor</b>, <b>rotates a worm-gear shaft</b> (a miniature version of the worm 
  gear in a bench-top vise) in minute increments that match the spacing between 
  tracks. The time it takes to get to the correct 
  track is called &quot;access time.&quot; This stepping action (partial revolutions) of 
  the stepper motor moves the read/write heads like the jaws of a bench-top 
  vise. The floppy-disk-drive electronics know how many steps the motor has to 
  turn to move the read/write heads to the correct track. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The <b>read/write heads stop at the 
  track</b>. The read head <b>checks the prewritten address</b> on the formatted 
  diskette to be sure it is using the correct side of the diskette and is at the 
  proper track. This operation is very similar to the way a record player 
  automatically goes to a certain groove on a vinyl record. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Before the data from the program is 
  written to the diskette, an <b>erase coil</b> (on the same read/write head 
  assembly) is energized to &quot;clear&quot; a wide, &quot;clean slate&quot; sector prior to 
  writing the sector data with the write head. The erased sector is wider than 
  the written sector -- this way, no signals from sectors in adjacent tracks 
  will interfere with the sector in the track being written. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The energized <b>write head puts data on 
  the diskette</b> by magnetizing minute, iron, bar-magnet particles embedded in 
  the diskette surface, very similar to the technology used in the mag stripe on 
  the back of a credit card. The magnetized particles have their north and south 
  poles oriented in such a way that their pattern may be detected and read on a 
  subsequent read operation. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The <b>diskette stops spinning</b>. The 
  floppy disk drive waits for the next command. </font></li>

Disk Drive Facts</font></h1>
<!-- dtl_id=24933 //-->
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Here are some interesting things to note 
about FDDs: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Two floppy disks do not get corrupted if 
  they are stored together, due to the low level of magnetism in each one.
  </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In your PC, there is a twist in the FDD 
  data-ribbon cable -- this twist tells the computer whether the drive is an 
  A-drive or a B-drive. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Like many household appliances, there 
  are really no serviceable parts in today's FDDs. This is because the cost of a 
  new drive is considerably less than the hourly rate typically charged to 
  disassemble and repair a drive. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you wish to redisplay the data on a 
  diskette drive after changing a diskette, you can simply tap the F5 key (in 
  most Windows applications). </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the corner of every 3.5-inch 
  diskette, there is a small slider. If you uncover the hole by moving the 
  slider, you have protected the data on the diskette from being written over or 
  erased. </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Floppy disks, while rarely used to 
  distribute software (as in the past), are still used in these applications:
