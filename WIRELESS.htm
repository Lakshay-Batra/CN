<p><b><font face="Arial">Wireless LAN Overview </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">WLAN technology and the WLAN industry date back to the 
mid-1980s when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) first made the RF 
spectrum available to industry. During the 1980s and early 1990s, growth was 
relatively slow. Today, however, WLAN technology is experiencing tremendous 
growth. The key reason for this growth is the increased bandwidth made possible 
by the IEEE 802.11 standard. As an introduction to the 802.11 and WLAN 
technology, Table 3-1 provides some key characteristics at a glance. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
<img height="491" src="wlantable.jpg" width="994"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>3.1.1 Brief History</b><br>
Motorola developed one of the first commercial WLAN systems with its Altair 
product. However, early WLAN technologies had several problems that prohibited 
its pervasive use. These LANs were expensive, provided low data rates, were 
prone to radio interference, and were designed mostly to proprietary RF 
technologies. The IEEE initiated the 802.11 project in 1990 with a scope “to 
develop a Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specification for 
wireless connectivity for fixed, portable, and moving stations within an area.” 
In 1997, IEEE first approved the 802.11 international interoperability standard. 
Then, in 1999, the IEEE ratified the 802.11a and the 802.11b wireless networking 
communication standards. The goal was to create a standards-based technology 
that could span multiple physical encoding types, frequencies, and applications. 
The 802.11a standard uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to 
reduce interference. This technology uses the 5 GHz frequency spectrum and can 
process data at up to 54 Mbps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>3.1.2 Frequency and Data Rates</b><br>
IEEE developed the 802.11 standards to provide wireless networking technology 
like the wired Ethernet that has been available for many years. The IEEE 802.11a 
standard is the most widely adopted member of the 802.11 WLAN family. It 
operates in the licensed 5 GHz band using OFDM technology. The popular 802.11b 
standard operates in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz–2.5 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and 
Medical (ISM) frequency band using a direct sequence spread-spectrum technology. 
The ISM band has become popular for wireless communications because it is 
available worldwide. The 802.11b WLAN technology permits transmission speeds of 
up to 11 Mbits per second. This makes it considerably faster than the original 
IEEE 802.11 standard (that sends data at up to 2 Mbps) and slightly faster than 
standard Ethernet. A summary of the various 802.11 standards is provided in 
Appendix D.<br>
<b>3.1.3 802.11 Architecture</b><br>
The IEEE 802.11 standard permits devices to establish either peer-to-peer (P2P) 
networks or networks based on fixed access points (AP) with which mobile nodes 
can communicate. Hence, the standard defines two basic network topologies: the 
infrastructure network and the ad hoc network. The infrastructure network is 
meant to extend the range of the wired LAN to wireless cells. A laptop or other 
mobile device may move from cell to cell (from AP to AP) while maintaining 
access to the resources of the LAN. A cell is the area covered by an AP and is 
called a “basic service set” (BSS). The collection of all cells of an 
infrastructure network is called an extended service set (ESS). This first 
topology is useful for providing wireless coverage of building or campus areas. 
By deploying multiple APs with overlapping coverage areas, organizations can 
achieve broad network coverage. WLAN technology can be used to replace wired 
LANs totally and to extend LAN infrastructure.<br>
A WLAN environment has wireless client stations that use radio modems to 
communicate to an AP. The client stations are generally equipped with a wireless 
network interface card (NIC) that consists of the radio transceiver and the 
logic to interact with the client machine and software. An AP comprises 
essentially a radio transceiver on one side and a bridge to the wired backbone 
on the other. The AP, a stationary device that is part of the wired 
infrastructure, is analogous to a cell-site (base station) in cellular 
communications. All communications between the client stations and between 
clients and the wired network go through the AP. The basic topology of a WLAN is 
depicted in Figure 3-1.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
<img src="wlantopo.jpg" width="968" height="752"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Although most WLANs operate in the “infrastructure” mode 
and architecture described above, another topology is also possible. This second 
topology, the ad hoc network, is meant to easily interconnect mobile devices 
that are in the same area (e.g., in the same room). In this architecture, client 
stations are grouped into a single geographic area and can be Internet-worked 
without access to the wired LAN (infrastructure network). The interconnected 
devices in the ad hoc mode are referred to as an independent basic service set (IBSS). 
The ad hoc topology is depicted in Figure 3-2 below.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
<img src="adhoctopo.jpg" width="700" height="525"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The ad hoc configuration is similar to a peer-to-peer 
office network in which no node is required to function as a server. As an ad 
hoc WLAN, laptops, desktops and other 802.11 devices can share files without the 
use of an AP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>3.1.4 Wireless LAN Components</b><br>
A WLAN comprises two types of equipment: a wireless station and an access point. 
A station, or client, is typically a laptop or notebook personal computer (PC) 
with a wireless NIC.12 A WLAN client may also be a desktop or handheld device 
(e.g., PDA, or custom device such as a barcode scanner) or equipment within a 
kiosk on a manufacturing floor or other publicly accessed area. Wireless laptops 
and notebooks—“wireless enabled”—are identical to laptops and notebooks except 
that they use wireless NICs to connect to access points in the network. The 
wireless NIC is commonly inserted in the client's Personal Computer Memory Card 
International Association (PCMCIA) slot or Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. The 
NICs use radio signals to establish connections to the WLAN. The AP, which acts 
as a bridge between the wireless and wired networks, typically comprises a 
radio, a wired network interface such as 802.3, and bridging software. The AP 
functions as a base station for the wireless network, aggregating multiple 
wireless stations onto the wired network.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>3.1.5 Range</b><br>
The reliable coverage range for 802.11 WLANs depends on several factors, 
including data rate required and capacity, sources of RF interference, physical 
area and characteristics, power, connectivity, and antenna usage. Theoretical 
ranges are from 29 meters (for 11 Mbps) in a closed office area to 485 meters 
(for 1 Mbps) in an open area. However, through empirical analysis, the typical 
range for connectivity of 802.11 equipment is approximately 50 meters (about 163 
ft.) indoors. A range of 400 meters, nearly ¼ mile, makes WLAN the ideal 
technology for many campus applications. It is important to recognize that 
special high-gain antennas can increase the range to several miles.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">
<img src="wlanrange.jpg" width="972" height="525"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">APs may also provide a “bridging” function. Bridging 
connects two or more networks together and allows them to communicate—to 
exchange network traffic. Bridging involves either a point-to-point or a 
multipoint configuration. In a point-to-point architecture, two LANs are 
connected to each other via the LANs’ respective APs. In multipoint bridging, 
one subnet on a LAN is connected to several other subnets on another LAN via 
each subnet AP. For example, if a computer on Subnet A needed to connect to 
computers on Subnets B, C, and D, Subnet A’s AP would connect to B’s, C’s, and 
D’s respective APs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><br>
Enterprises may use bridging to connect LANs between different buildings on 
corporate campuses. Bridging AP devices are typically placed on top of buildings 
to achieve greater antenna reception. The typical distance over which one AP can 
be connected wirelessly to another by means of bridging is approximately 2 
miles. This distance may vary depending on several factors including the 
specific receiver or transceiver being used.13 Figure 3-4 illustrates 
point-to-point bridging between two LANs. In the example, wireless data is being 
transmitted from Laptop A to Laptop B, from one building to the next, using each 
building’s appropriately positioned AP. Laptop A connects to the closest AP 
within the building A. The receiving AP in building A then transmits the data 
(over the wired LAN) to the AP bridge located on the building’s roof. That AP 
bridge then transmits the data to the bridge on nearby building B. The 
building’s AP bridge then sends the data over its wired LAN to Laptop B.</font></p>

</ul>
<p><b><font face="Arial">DSSS:- Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black">This is 
probably the most widely recognized form of spread spectrum.&nbsp;&nbsp;The DSSS process 
is performed by effectively multiplying an RF carrier and a pseudo-noise (PN) 
digital signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;First the PN code is modulated onto the information signal 
using one of several modulation techniques (eg. BPSK, QPSK, etc ).&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, a 
doubly balanced mixer is used to multiply the RF carrier and PN modulated 
information signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;This process causes the RF signal to be replaced with a 
very wide bandwidth signal with the spectral equivalent of a noise signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
demodulation process (for the BPSK case) is then simply the mixing/multiplying 
of the same PN modulated carrier with the incoming RF signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The output is a 
signal that is a maximum when the two signals exactly equal one another or are 
&quot;correlated&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;The correlated signal is then filtered and sent to a BPSK 
demodulator.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black">The signals 
generated with this technique appear as noise in the frequency domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide 
bandwidth provided by the PN code allows the signal power to drop below the 
noise threshold without loss of information.&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectral content of an SS 
signal is shown in Fig. 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that this is just the spectrum of a BPSK signal 
with a (sin x / x)2 form.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
<font face="Arial"><b><span style="color:black">Fig. 1 BPSK DSSS Spectrum</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black">The bandwidth 
in DSSS systems is often taken as the null-to-null bandwidth of the main lobe of 
the power spectral density plot (indicated as 2Rc in Fig. 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;The half power 
bandwidth of this lobe is 1.2 Rc, where Rc is the chip rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the 
bandwidth of a DSSS system is a direct function of the chip rate; specifically 
2Rc/RINFO.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just an extension of the previous equation for process 
gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the power contained in the main lobe comprises 90 
percent of the total power.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows a narrower RF bandwidth to accommodate 
the received signal with the effect of rounding the received pulses in the time 
domain.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black">One feature of 
DSSS is that QPSK may be used to increase the data rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase of a 
factor of two bits per symbol of transmitted information over BPSK causes an 
equivalent reduction in the available process gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;The process gain is reduced 
because for a given chip rate, the bandwidth (which sets the process gain) is 
halved due to the two-fold increase in information transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that 
systems in a spectrally quiet environment benefit from the possible increase in 
data transfer rate.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">FHSS: Frequency Hopped Spread Spectrum</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Frequency hopping relies on frequency diversity to 
  combat interference.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is accomplished by multiple frequency, code 
  selected, FSK.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the incoming digital stream is shifted in frequency 
  by an amount determined by a code that spreads the signal power over a wide 
  bandwidth.&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison to binary FSK, which has only two possible 
  frequencies, FHSS may have 2*10^20 or more.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The FHSS transmitter is a pseudo-noise PN code 
  controlled frequency synthesizer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The instantaneous frequency output of the 
  transmitter jumps from one value to another based on the pseudo-random input 
  from the code generator (see Fig. 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;Varying the instantaneous frequency 
  results in an output spectrum that is effectively spread over the range of 
  frequencies generated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Fig.1 FHSS Spectrum</b></font></p>
</center>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">In this system, 
the number of discrete frequencies determines the bandwidth of the 
system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the process gain is directly dependent on the number of 
available frequency choices for a given information rate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Another important 
factor in FHSS systems is the rate at which the hops occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum time 
required to change frequencies is dependent on the information bit rate, the 
amount of redundancy used, and the distance to the nearest interference source.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">
Frequency-hopping spread spectrum</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> (<b>FHSS</b>) 
is a spread-spectrum method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly switching a 
carrier among many frequency channels, using a pseudorandom sequence known to 
both transmitter and receiver.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">A spread-spectrum 
transmission offers three main advantages over a fixed-frequency transmission:</span></p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">Spread-spectrum signals are highly resistant 
  to noise and interference. The process of re-collecting a spread signal 
  spreads out noise and interference, causing them to recede into the 
  background. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">Spread-spectrum signals are difficult to 
  intercept. A Frequency-Hop spread-spectrum signal sounds like a momentary 
  noise burst or simply an increase in the background noise for short 
  Frequency-Hop codes on any narrowband receiver except a Frequency-Hop 
  spread-spectrum receiver using the exact same channel sequence as was used by 
  the transmitter. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">Spread-spectrum transmissions can share a 
  frequency band with many types of conventional transmissions with minimal 
  interference. The spread-spectrum signals add minimal noise to the 
  narrow-frequency communications, and vice versa. As a result, bandwidth can be 
  utilized more efficiently. </span></li>

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">OFDM: Orthogonal 
frequency-division multiplexing</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">
Comparison to FDM</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">In FDM, multiple 
signals are sent out at the same time, but on different frequencies. Most people 
are familiar with FDM from radio and television: normally, each station 
broadcasts on a particular frequency band (range of frequencies) or channel.</span></p>
<ul type="disc" lastCheckbox="null" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">OFDM takes this concept further: In OFDM, a 
  single transmitter transmits on many (typically dozens to thousands) different 
  orthogonal frequencies (i.e. frequencies that are independent with respect to 
  the relative phase relationship between the frequencies). Also, because the 
  frequencies are so closely spaced, each one only has room for a Narrowband 
  signal. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">This modulation technique coupled with the use 
  of advanced modulation techniques on each component, results in a signal with 
  high resistance to interference. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">
Coupling with &quot;channel coding&quot;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">OFDM is almost 
always used in conjunction with channel coding—an error correction technique—to 
create <b>coded orthogonal FDM</b> or <b>COFDM</b>. It is a complex technology 
to implement, but it is now widely used in digital telecommunications systems to 
make it easier to encode and decode such signals. The system has been used in 
broadcasting as well as certain types of computer networking technology. This is 
particularly due to the fact that such signals show good resistance to multipath 
fading, best known as the source of &quot;ghosting&quot; on analog television broadcasts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">According to 
Stott, 1997, &quot;The 'COFDM magic' is achieved by the use of channel-state 
information (CSI). In the presence of CW interferers and/or a selective channel, 
some OFDM carriers will be worse affected than others.&quot; The channel coding thus 
allows the receiver to integrate information about the physical S/N ratios of 
the subchannels into the error correction of its Viterbi decoder, yielding 
significantly better performance than uncoded OFDM can attain with similar 
channel characteristics.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">
Characteristics</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">An OFDM carrier 
signal is the sum of a number of orthogonal sub-carriers, with baseband data on 
each sub-carrier being independently modulated commonly using some type of 
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or phase-shift keying (PSK). This 
composite baseband signal is typically used to modulate a main RF carrier.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt">Benefits</span></font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The benefits of 
using OFDM are many, including high spectrum efficiency, resistance against 
multipath interference (particularly in wireless communications), and ease of 
filtering out noise (if a particular range of frequencies suffers from 
interference, the carriers within that range can be disabled or made to run 
slower). Also, the upstream and downstream speeds can be varied by allocating 
either more or fewer carriers for each purpose. Some forms of Rate-adaptive DSL 
use this feature in real time, so that bandwidth is allocated to whichever 
stream needs it most.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">An extremely 
important benefit from using multiple sub-carriers is that because each carrier 
operates at a relatively low bitrate, the duration of each symbol is relatively 
long. If one sends, say, a million bits per second over a single baseband 
channel, then the duration of each bit must be under a microsecond. This imposes 
severe constraints on sychronization and removal of multipath interference. If 
the same million bits per second are spread among N subcarriers, the duration of 
each bit can be longer by a factor of N, and the constraints of timing and 
multipath sensitivity are greatly relaxed. For moving vehicles, the doppler 
effect on signal timing is another constraint that causes difficulties for some 
other modulation schemes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">OFDM modulation 
and demodulation are typically (as of 2001) implemented using digital filter 
banks generally using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Although highly 
complex, COFDM has high performance under even very challenging channel 
conditions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">By combining the 
OFDM technique with error-correcting codes, adaptive equalization and 
reconfigurable modulation, COFDM has the following properties:</span></p>
<ul type="disc" lastCheckbox="null" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">resistance against link dispersion </span>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">resistance against slowly changing phase 
  distortion and fading </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">resistance against multipath using guard 
  interval and cyclic prefix </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">resistance against frequency response nulls 
  and constant frequency interference </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">resistance against burst noise </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">COFDM also 
generally has a nearly 'white' spectrum, giving it benign electromagnetic 
interference properties with respect to other signals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Some COFDM systems 
use some of the sub-carriers to carry pilot signals, which are used for 
frequency synchronization. (Loss of synchronization causes errors in the decoded 
data).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">In wide area 
broadcasting, receivers can benefit from receiving signals from several 
spatially dispersed transmitters simultaneously, since transmitters will only 
destructively interfere with each other on a limited number of subcarriers, 
whereas in general they will actually reinforce coverage over a wide area. This 
is very beneficial in many countries, as it permits the operation of national 
single frequency networks, and avoids the replication of program content on 
different carrier frequencies which is necessary with FM or other forms of radio 
broadcasting. Also, because effectively the bit rate is slowed down on each 
sub-carrier, the effects of &quot;ghosting&quot; are much reduced. Such single frequency 
networks utilize the available spectrum more effectively than existing analogue 
radio networks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">
&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Disadvantages of OFDM</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">However, OFDM suffers from time-variations in the channel, 
or presence of a carrier frequency offset. This is due to the fact that the OFDM 
subcarriers are spaced closely in frequency. Imperfect frequency synchronization 
causes a loss in subcarrier orthogonality which severely degrades performance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Because the signal is the sum of a large number of 
subcarriers, it tends to have a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Also, 
it is necessary to minimise intermodulation between the subcarriers, which would 
effectively raise the noise floor both in-channel and out of channel. For this 
reason circuitry must be very linear. This is demanding, especially in relation 
to high power RF circuitry, which also needs to be efficient in order to 
minimise power consumption.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">Terrestrial digital radio and television 
broadcasting</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">Much of Europe and Asia has adopted COFDM for terrestrial 
broadcasting of television and radio. The television standard is called
DVB-T and the radio standard is called DAB.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">
DVB-T's implementation of COFDM for digital television</span></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">COFDM is also now 
widely used in Europe and elsewhere for terrestrial digital TV using the DVB-T 
standard. One of the major benefits provided by COFDM is that it renders radio 
broadcasts relatively immune to multipath distortion, and signal fading due to 
atmospheric conditions, or passing aircraft. The United States has rejected 
several proposals to adopt COFDM for its digital television services, and has 
instead opted for 8VSB (vestigial sideband modulation) operation. The question 
of the relative technical merits of COFDM versus 8VSB has been a subject of some 
controversy between Europe</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> and </span><span style="font-family:
  Arial">USA</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The debate over 
8VSB vs COFDM modulation is still ongoing. Proponents of COFDM argue that it 
resists multipath far better than 8VSB. Early 8VSB DTV (digital television) 
receivers often had difficulty receiving a signal in urban environments. 
However, newer 8VSB receivers are far better at dealing with multipath. 
Moreover, 8VSB modulation requires less power to transmit a signal the same 
distance. In less-populated areas, 8VSB often pulls ahead of COFDM because of 
this. In urban areas, however, COFDM still offers better reception than 8VSB.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial">
DRM and Eureka-147's (DAB) implementation of COFDM for digital audio 
broadcasting</span></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">COFDM is also used 
for other radio standards, for digital audio broadcasting (DAB), the standard 
for digital audio broadcasting at VHF frequencies and also for Digital Radio 
Mondiale (DRM), the standard for digital broadcasting at shortwave and 
mediumwave frequencies (below 30 MHz).</span></p>
<ul type="disc" lastCheckbox="null" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">The USA again uses an alternate standard, a 
  proprietary system developed by iBiquity dubbed &quot;HD Radio&quot;. However, it uses 
  COFDM as the underlying broadcast technology to add digital audio to AM (mediumwave) 
  and FM broadcasts. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family:Arial">Both Digital Radio Mondiale and HD Radio are

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Flash-OFDM (Fast 
Low-latency Access with Seamless Handoff Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing) is a system that is based on OFDM and specifies also higher 
protocol layers. It has been developed and is marketed by Flarion. Flash-OFDM 
has generated interest as a packet-switched cellular bearer, on which area it 
would compete with GSM and 3G networks. As an example, old 450 MHz frequency 
bands that were used by NMT (an 1G analog network, now decommissioned) in Europe</span><span style="font-family:

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">American wireless 
carrier Sprint Nextel has stated plans for using Flash-OFDM (along with other 
wireless broadband network technologies) for their 4G offering, which will be 
deployed using the licences they own nationwide in the 2.5GHz frequency range.</span></p>

<h3><font face="Arial" size="3">BST-OFDM</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The BST-OFDM (Band Segmented Transmission - Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplexing) system proposed for Japan improves upon COFDM 
by exploiting the fact that some OFDM carriers may be modulated differently from 
others within the same multiplex. The 6 MHz television channel may therefore be 
&quot;segmented&quot;, with different segments being modulated differently and used for 
different services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It is possible, for example, to send an audio service on a 
segment that includes a segment comprised of a number of carriers, a data 
service on another segment and a television service on yet another segment - all 
within the same 6 MHz television channel. Furthermore, these may be modulated 
with different parameters so that, for example, the audio and data services 
could be optimized for mobile reception, while the television service is 
optimized for stationary reception in a high-multipath environment.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Ideal encoder</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">The following picture shows the possible ideal structure 
of a OFDM encoder:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Ideal%201.bmp" width="800" height="220"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The source <i>S</i> generates a flow of binary symbols. 
They are split up into several channels, thus creating short sequence of binary 
symbols. In the picture they are indicated with the name <i>M<sub>i</sub></i>; 
in general they can have different length. Then each sequence is represented by 
a complex number <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> according to any kind of modulation (QAM, PSK, etc.). The sequence of <i>
a<sub>i</sub></i> to be transmitted is interpreted as the spectrum of the signal 
to be sent: so all the complex values are sent to a block that calculates the 
inverse Fourier transform using the FFT algorithm. Some zeros can 
be added at the beginning and at the end of the sequence. Then a header <i>H</i> 
is appended to the code at the output of the FFT. The obtained sequence will be, 
in general, complex-valued. The real and imaginary part are sent separately 
through the channel by QAM modulation. Before modulation, they are alternatively 
multiplied by <i>(-1)</i> in order to have a null mean value.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In general there can be a different modulating technique 
on each virtual channel. Since different symbols are sent on different samples 
of the spectrum of the signal to be sent, if the channel has a linear behavior, 
there can not be any interference between the different frequency, so any 
possibility of intersymbol interference is 
removed.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Mathematical description</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">The low-pass equivalent OFDM signal is expressed as</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="EQN1.bmp" width="317" height="60"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">where <span class="texhtml">{<i>I</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>}</span> 
are the data symbols, <span class="texhtml"><i>N</i></span> is the number of 
subcarriers, and <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i></span> is the OFDM block time. 
The subcarriers spacing of <span class="texhtml">1 / <i>T</i></span> Hz makes 
the subcarriers orthogonal; this property is expressed as</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="EQ2.bmp" width="607" height="63"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">where (.)*

<p><font face="Arial">To avoid intersymbol interference in multipath fading 
channels, a guard interval
<img border="0" src="EQN6.png" width="110" height="23">, 
where <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>g</sub></span> is the guard period, is 
inserted prior to the OFDM block. During this interval, a <i>cyclic prefix</i> 
is transmitted. The cyclic prefix is equal to the last <span class="texhtml"><i>

<p><font face="Arial">In OFDM the subcarrier pulse used for transmission is 
chosen to be rectangular. This has the advantage that the task of pulse forming 
and modulation can be performed by a simple <em>Inverse Discrete Fourier 
Transform</em> (IDFT) which can be implemented very efficiently as a <em>I Fast 
Fourier Transform</em> (IFFT). Accordingly in the receiver we only need a FFT to 
reverse this operation. According to the theorems of the Fourier Transform the 
rectangular pulse shape will lead to a <i>sin</i>(<i>x</i>)/<i>x</i> type of 
spectrum of the subcarriers (see figure 0.5). </font>

<strong>Figure 0.5:</strong> OFDM and the orthogonality principle<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Obviously the spectrums of the subcarriers are not 
separated but overlap. The reason why the information transmitted over the 
carriers can still be separated is the so called orthogonality relation giving 
the method its name. By using an IFFT for modulation we implicitly chose the 
spacing of the subcarriers in such a way that at the frequency where we evaluate 
the received signal (indicated as arrows) all other signals are zero. In order 
for this orthogonality to be preserved the following must be true: </font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">The receiver and the transmitter must be perfectly 
  synchronized. This means they both must assume exactly the same modulation 
  frequency and the same time-scale for transmission (which usually is not the 
  case). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The analog components, part of transmitter and 
  receiver, must be of very high quality. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">There should be no multipath channel. </font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial">In particular the last point is quite a pity, since we 
have chosen this approach to combat the multipath channel. Fortunately there's 
an easy solution for this problem: The OFDM symbols are artificially prolonged 
by periodically repeating the 'tail' of the symbol and precede the symbol with 
it (see figure 0.5). At the receiver this so 
called guard interval is removed again. As long as the length of this interval
<img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline318" src="img14.gif" align="bottom" width="14" height="14"> 
is longer than the maximum channel delay
<img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline290" src="img3.gif" align="middle" width="34" height="17"> 
all reflections of previous symbols are removed and the orthogonality is 
preserved. Of course this is not for free, since by preceding the useful part of 
length
<img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline322" src="img15.gif" align="middle" width="18" height="27"> 
by the guard interval we lose some parts of the signal that cannot be used for 
transmitting information. Taking all this into account the signal model for the 
OFDM transmission over a multipath channel becomes very simple: The transmitted 
symbols at time-slot <i>l</i> and subcarrier <i>k</i> are only disturbed by a 
factor
<img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline328" src="img16.gif" align="middle" width="30" height="27">
