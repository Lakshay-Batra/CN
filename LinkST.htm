<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">A <b>link-state routing 
protocol</b> is one of the two main classes of routing protocols used in 
packet-switched networks for computer communications. Examples of link-state 
routing protocols include OSPF and IS-IS.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">The link-state protocol is 
performed by every <i>switching node</i> in the network (i.e. nodes which are 
prepared to forward packets; in the Internet, these are called routers). The 
basic concept of link-state routing is that every node receives a <i>map</i> of 
the connectivity of the network, in the form of a graph showing which nodes are 
connected to which other nodes.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Each node then independently 
calculates the best <i>next hop</i> from it for every possible destination in 
the network. (It does this using only its local copy of the map, and without 
communicating in any other way with any other node.) The collection of best next 
hops forms the routing table for the node.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">This contrasts with 
distance-vector routing protocols, which work by having each node share its <b>
routing table</b> with its neighbors. In a link-state protocol, the only 
information passed between the nodes is information used to construct the 
connectivity maps.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">A complex routing protocol 
that shares information with other routers in order to determine the best path. 
IS-IS was the first comprehensive link state protocol, and OSPF and NLSP evolved 
from it. Link state protocols use characteristics of the route such as speed and 
cost as well as current congestion to determine the best path, which is 
typically computed by the Dijkstra algorithm.<br>
<br>
Link state routers are updated from all the routers in the entire network by 
passing information from router to nearest router. Rather than continuously 
broadcast its routing tables as does a distance vector protocol, a link state 
protocol router only notifies its neighboring routers when it detects a change. 
Contrast with distance vector protocol and path vector protocol. See routing 
protocol, OSPF, NLSP and IS-IS.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">HOP:</span></b><span style="font-family:
Arial"> An intermediate connection in a string of connections linking two 
network devices. On the Internet, for example, most data packets need to go 
through several routers before they reach their final destination. Each time the 
packet is forwarded to the next router, a hop occurs. The more hops, the longer 
it takes for data to go from source to destination. You can see how many hops it 
takes to get to another Internet host by using the </span>
<span style="font-family:Arial">PING</span><span style="font-family:
Arial"> or traceroute utilities. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial">Some Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs) advertise how many hops away from Internet backbone they are. 
Theoretically, the fewer hops it takes to get your data onto the backbone, the 
faster your access will be.</span>&nbsp;</p>
