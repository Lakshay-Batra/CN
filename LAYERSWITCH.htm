<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A network device that cross connects 
clients, servers and network devices. Also known as a &quot;frame switch,&quot; 
stand-alone LAN switches are common in all Ethernet networks. A four-port switch 
is also typically built into a wired or wireless router for homes and small 
business.<br>
<br>
LAN switches have been available for Token Ring and FDDI networks, which have 
mostly given way to Ethernet. ATM switches however are a type of LAN switch that

<br>
An Ethernet network that is controlled by a switch instead of a shared hub. The 
switch cross connects all clients, servers and network devices, giving each 
sending-receiving pair the full rated transmission speed. Half-duplex speed 
between nodes is 10 Mbps for Ethernet (10BaseT) and 100 Mbps for Fast Ethernet 
(100BaseT). Full-duplex is 20 and 200 Mbps. For more connections, a switch port 
can be wired to another switch or hub.<br>
<br>
<b>From Shared to Switched</b><br>
Migrating from shared Ethernet to switched Ethernet provides a dramatic increase 
in throughput. For example, a 24-port 100BaseT hub shares the total 200 Mbps 
bandwidth with all 24 attached nodes. By replacing the hub with a switch, each 
of the 12 sender/receiver pairs has the full 200 Mbps capacity.<br>
<br>
In addition, the migration only requires replacing older hubs with switches. The 
existing network adapters (NICs) in every computer that were previously 
connected to the hub are still valid when wired to the switch.</span></font></font></h3>

<b>Description</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">An Ethernet switch is used to interconnect a number of 
Ethernet local area networks (LANs) to form a large Ethernet network. Different 
ports of the switch are connected to different LAN segments. The purpose of the 
switch is to forward the packets only to the desired destination segment of the 
network whenever possible, minimizing traffic on the network. MorethanIP, an 
Altera partner, has developed a flexible Ethernet switching engine that allows 
designers to implement any additional function to complement the Ethernet switch 
and to provide connectivity to a large number of standard parts or systems with 
a single-chip solution.&nbsp;The switch can be implemented in Altera’s 
high-performance Stratix&nbsp;II family and low-cost Cyclone&nbsp;II family.</font></p>

</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="story">Among their features and 
characteristics are: <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>Auto-sensing.</b> A switch’s auto-sensing capability means it can determine 
the speed of attached devices and automatically configure the ports for 10-Mbps 
or 100-Mbps throughput. It does this by reading the speed of the network adapter 
or network interface card attached to the networked PC or server. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>Auto-negotiation.</b> A switch’s ability to automatically negotiate between 
half- and full-duplex modes is extremely useful for particularly 
bandwidth-hungry client applications, such as a remote computer-aided design and 
manufacturing workstation. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
Full-duplex Fast Ethernet mode temporarily shuts down the Ethernet carrier-sense 
multiple-access with collision detection and loopback functions, allowing the 
switch to provide a theoretical bandwidth of 200 Mbps; that is, 100 Mbps in each 
direction. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
But this capability comes at the expense of some of the collision detection 
features of half-duplex mode and should be only be used for isolated high-speed 
workstations where collision detection isn’t required. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>Top aggregate bandwidth.</b> Aggregate bandwidth is the top theoretical speed 
limit of each switch and is related to the number of ports employed. Thus, the 
aggregate bandwidth of an eight-port switch running at 100 Mbps per port is 800 
Mbps, while it’s 1.6 Gbps for a 16-port switch. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>Store-and-forward.</b> The simplest switches operate as cut-through devices, 
meaning they only examine a packet’s destination before forwarding it. More 
advanced store-and-forward switches analyze the entire packet before forwarding 
it. The tradeoff? Store-and-forwarding eliminates many traffic errors but takes 
longer than the cut-through technique. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>Unmanaged.</b> Workgroup switches may be managed or unmanaged. Unmanaged 
switches are plug-and-play devices and are a good match for small, flat networks 
with a mixture of 10-Mbps and 100-Mbps legacy devices. They can automatically 
learn network addresses and can handle both auto-sensing and auto-negotiation.
<br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
The best thing about them is their price. 3Com Corp.’s Office Connect Dual Speed 
Switch 8 is priced at $210, and Accton Technology Corp.’s popular CheetahSwitch 
Workgroup 3008A has been reduced to $199. D-Link Systems Inc.’s DSS8+ can be 
bought for as low as $87 from third-party vendors, and ARK Technologies’ $75 
CT2208D unmanaged switch is the cheapest I’ve seen—less than $10 per port.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><span class="story">
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>Managed.</b> Managed switches, in the $1,000 and up price range, are more 
expensive because they perform more services. Network management features are 
important when remote switch management is required, or when several switches 
are linked as part of a more complex network than a LAN. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
Products such as Allied Telesyn International Corp.’s $1,369, 16-port AT-8118 
and all of Cisco Systems Inc.’s Catalyst 2900XL models—priced at $964 and 
up—come with proprietary management software. The software most often combines 
Simple Network Management Protocol and Remote Monitoring network management 
standards, with their own network management flavors and a little Web-based 
management tossed in. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>Scalability.</b> Simply adding users to a switch or connecting your switch to 
a network backbone switch is one way to scale your network upward. Rackmountable 
switches are more easily scalable than standalone desktop switches. Intel 
Corp.’s high-end switches with built-in Scalable Stacking Technology incorporate 
a scalable backplane into the switch stack. But the company’s standalone Express 
410T and 510T models listed here don’t offer this feature. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>VLAN support.</b> Managed Layer 2 switches such as Accton’s $785 
CheetahSwitch Workgroup 3514F and all of IBM’s 8275 series can support virtual 
LANs, either as a bundled or optional feature. A VLAN is a group of network 
resources or users on different network segments that communicate as if they 
were on the same wire. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
Users can be linked by media access control addresses, IP addresses, network 
protocols or even the port numbers of a LAN switch into a virtual grouping that 
can share network resources and bandwidth. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
VLANs are tied to Layer 2 technology, however, and as Layer 3 switches providing 
full Gigabit Ethernet wire-speed routing enter the market, they may disappear.
<br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>Diagnostic port LEDs.</b> LED indicators at each switch port generally 
indicate the activity of the link, such as 10-Mbps or 100-Mbps bandwidth 
utilization or collision/full-duplex. An on/off switch LED light is included 
with virtually all switches. <br>
<img height="9" alt=" " src="clearpixel.gif" width="1" border="0"><br>
<b>Media compatibility.</b> A big advantage to 100Base-T Fast Ethernet is that 
it runs over the same 10Base-T media that standard Ethernet uses. 100Base-TX—two 
pairs of data-grade Category 54 unshielded and shielded twisted-pair wiring—and 
100Base-FX—two strands of multimode fiber—have emerged as the most popular 
cabling schemes in most wiring closets, so be sure that your switch supports 
them with appropriate connectors. The most popular media for Gigabit Ethernet 
uplinks is 1000Base-SX, which uses multimode fiber, but the more versatile, 
copper-based 1000Base-CX technology is coming on strong.</span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><span class="term_title">Layer 3 Switch</span> <br>
</b><br>
A network device that forwards traffic based on layer 3 information at very high 
speeds. Traditionally, routers, which inspect layer 3, were considerably slower 
than layer 2 switches. In order to increase routing speeds, many &quot;cut-through&quot; 
techniques were used, which perform an &quot;inspect the first packet at layer 3 and 
send the rest at layer 2&quot; type of processing. Ipsilon's IP Switch and 
Cabletron's SecureFast switches were pioneers in cut-through switching.<br>
<br>
As more routing lookup functions were moved from software into the ASIC chips, 
layer 3 switches could inspect each packet just like a router at high speed 
without using proprietary cut-through methods. If a layer 3 switch supports 
packet-by-packet inspection and supports routing protocols, it is called a 
&quot;routing switch&quot; or &quot;switch router,&quot; which simply means &quot;fast router.&quot; For 
example, Cisco calls its high-end routers Gigabit Switch Routers.<br>
<br>
The more deeply a packet is examined, the more forwarding decisions can be made 
based upon type of traffic, quality of service and so on. To get to this 
information means digging into the packet's headers to ferret out the data, 
which takes processing time. To understand how the packets are formed, see 
TCP/IP abc's. The following shows what is examined at each layer.<br>

<h1 align="center" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Layer 3 
Switching</font></h1>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>The reason</b><br>
The idea of switching on layer 3 was first proposed by a company called
Ipsilon. Different standards emerged and at the moment of writing this 
document there is still no definitive standard. There are some solutions though 
that are incorporated in a standard (like ATM). For detailed descriptions see 
the vendors Web-Sites mentioned.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>The problems, or network history in an eye-wink</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
Before looking at the solutions it is good to see what is causing the problems.<br>
First, when networks emerged there was a need to extend the maximum distances, 
so repeaters were invented. After that, people wanted to connect LANs over Wide 
Area Networks (WANs). This problem was solved by building bridges. When more and 
more networks were linked together routers were needed to make the whole thing 
managable.<br>
And when we had that we wanted more speed. More speed meant creating switches. 
The first were just called switches and switched on OSI layer 2, so they were 
actually switching bridges and now we need more speed and have real time traffic 
and need 3rd layer switches, which are actually switched routers.<br>
But since a router is situated on layer 3 it adds delay and there is another 
problem with routers, they route. This means that data can follow different 
routes to their destination with as a result that some packages will arrive 
earlier than packedges send before them. This makes it impossible to run time 
sensitive applications.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>The solutions</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The problems that need to be solved is the different routes for packages 
from the same job and the delay added by the routers.<br>
Solving different routes seems to be the easiest one. Just take a fixed path and 
the problem is solved, but implementing this is the real problem.<br>
Solving the delay factor, once there is a fixed path, is actually a piece of 
cake, because with a fixed path bridging is all that is needed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial">The propositions for call setup</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The solution for a fixed path is a call setup, where there 
is a detection of the destination and an agreement on the path that is used for 
the time the link is used. The technics used sound like ATM and that is were 
everyone agrees on; ATM will be the future. But in the meantime we have an 
installed base of several thousands of routers which are connected through 
dedicated lines and no ATM. So there is a need for a temporary different 
solution.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Let's see what the posibilities are on the 3rd and 2nd 
layer of the OSI reference model:</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Route once, switch afterwards VS Switch where you can, 
route where you must</b><br>
Those two options have a basic different view of the network. The switch where 
you can device sees the network as being flat and is mainly a bridge. Only when 
it isn't able to determine where the data must go it will use it routing 
capabilities.<br>
The otherone is mainly concerned about routing. It accepts the network as a must 
route network. Only when it has the knowledge of the path the data ought to go 
it will switch.<br>

</b>Traditional routers, once the core components of enterprise networks, became 
a major obstacle to the migration toward next-generation networks. All the magic 
and alchemy involved in trying to make a software-based router forward packets 
more quickly created only an illusion of serious Layer 3 routing performance. A 
fundamental shift in technology was required. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In 1992, 3Com, a pioneer in both Layer 2 switching and 
traditional routing, began integrating its switching and routing products. The 
motivation was twofold: to reduce the number of devices to be managed, and to 
lower the cost of a combined Layer 2 and 3 solution. Though the first solution 
was mostly software based, subsequent products displayed increasing use of 
application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)—first for address table 
queries, then for forwarding packets. In 1997, 3Com delivered its 
third-generation, fully ASIC-enabled Layer 3 CoreBuilder™ 3500 switch, based on 
the Flexible Intelligent Routing Engine (FIRE) ASIC. For more information on 
FIRE, see the white paper &quot;Flexible Intelligent Routing Engine (FIRE): The

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><i>A Layer 3 Switch Is a Router</i></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
Vendors and the trade press alike have tried to apply the term &quot;Layer 3 switch&quot; 
to various products of the day, succeeding only in confusing IT decision makers. 
This paper aims to remove that confusion. A Layer 3 switch does everything to a 
packet that a traditional router does: </font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Determines forwarding path based on Layer 3 information
  </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Validates the integrity of the Layer 3 header via 
  checksum </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Verifies packet expiration and updates accordingly
  </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Processes and responds to any option information </font>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Updates forwarding statistics in the Management 
  Information Base (MIB) </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Applies security controls if required </font></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Because it is designed to handle high-performance LAN 
traffic, a Layer 3 switch can be placed anywhere within a network core or 
backbone, easily and cost-effectively replacing the traditional collapsed 
backbone router. The Layer 3 switch communicates with the WAN router using 
industry-standard routing protocols like RIP and OSPF. </font></p>
</a><a target="main" name="Domains">
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Router Interfaces as Layer 2 Switching Domains</i></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
The Layer 3 switch has inherent Layer 2 switching domains per interface, 
allowing for individual subnet bandwidth allocation, along with broadcast 
containment. Not all interfaces are created equal, so the ability to group ports 
together, whether based on physical characteristics or protocol information, is 
an extremely powerful tool for network designers concerned with capacity 
planning. This architecture is inherently scalable, capable of supporting 
numerous external Layer 2 switches that reside either in the data center or the 
wiring closet. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Such a design model preserves the subnetted 
infrastructure, concurrently boosting performance of those subnets and enabling 
the deployment of switched 10, 100, or 1000 Mbps right to the desktop if so 
desired. The concept of &quot;subnet preservation&quot; is the key to effective and 
trouble-free network migration—it allows gradual migration, helping IT managers 
to work within their staffing constraints without the need to renumber and 
reassign their entire network. </font></p>
<p align="justify"></a><a target="main" name="Policy"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Effective Application of Policy</i></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
As previously stated, contemporary Layer 3 switches perform their 
forwarding—whether Layer 2, Layer 3, unicast, multicast, or broadcast—in 
hardware. Software is deployed to handle network administration, table 
management, and exception conditions. Some technologists view the hardware 
component of a Layer 3 switch as inflexible. In fact, hardware provides the 
ultimate flexibility not only in performance, but in parallel processing as 
well. The parallel processing model allows the network device to perform far 
more operations on packets than previously imagined, especially with respect to 
the application of policy. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">A policy is a mechanism to alter the normal forwarding of 
a packet through a networking device. Familiar examples include security, load 
balancing, and protocol option processing. Newer policies include QoS, a way to 
allocate bandwidth and control propagation delay, in addition to CoS, a way to 
manage packet prioritization. QoS and CoS policies are not only meant to enable 
new multimedia applications, such as LAN telephony, but to ensure network 
response time for mission-critical applications, such as telemedicine. Policy 
implemented by intelligent networking devices, such as Layer 3 switches, enables 
the integration of voice, video, and data onto the same infrastructure, a 
process 3Com calls convergence. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Software-based architectures cannot seamlessly administer 
policy controls at even moderate rates of speed (beyond 10 Mbps). The Layer 3 
switch solves the problem, enabling policies to be applied at the same 
performance levels as ordinary Layer 2 and 3 forwarding. Further innovation 
allows the Layer 3 switch to apply policy based on Layer 4 information, such as 
TCP and UDP port information. Forward thinkers refer to this as &quot;Layer 4 
switching.&quot; The FIRE architecture supports all these policies, all the way to 
Layer 4. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Even with the massive capacity additions being planned for 
many networks, effective policy management enabled by Layer 3 switching is key 
to the protection and availability of critical resources. </font></p>
<p align="justify"></a><a target="main" name="Ease"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Ease of Management</i></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
One of the critical success factors for the Layer 2 switch was its 
implementation and operational simplicity. Deployment was often as easy as 
powering on the switch, assigning it an IP address, and making the physical 
network connections. Routers, on the other hand, required extensive training and 
forced users to sift through a multitude of arcane commands. Layer 3 switches 
remove such complexity. Setting up a routed environment is as simple as setting 
up a Layer 2 switch, defining the routed interface, and enabling the routing 
protocols. IT managers concerned about their investment in training staff on 
traditional router platforms must assess whether this is truly an investment, or 
simply a sunk cost based upon vendor lock-in schemes. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">For the network management application perspective, a 
Layer 3 switch behaves exactly as a legacy router does. Because of its Layer 2 
component, extensive Remote Monitoring (RMON) capabilities are available. 
However, since Layer 3 and Layer 4 capabilities are present in the Layer 3 
switch, higher-layer monitoring is available with RMON2 technology. RMON and 
RMON2 have historically been deployed with expensive external devices known as 
probes. Moving the RMON/RMON2 capability into the Layer 3 switch is a major 
benefit for IT administrators. </font></p>
<p align="justify"></a><a target="main" name="Routing"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Layer 3 Switching vs. Traditional Routing</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><br>
By now, it should be clear that a Layer 3 switch can be deployed anywhere in the 
LAN where a traditional router can be or has been used.<br>
Table 2 compares the two types of devices. The Layer 3 switch has been optimized 
for high-performance LAN support and is not meant to service wide area 
connections (although it could easily satisfy the requirements for 
high-performance MAN connectivity, such as SONET). This optimization boosts the 
performance of a Layer 3 switch to as much as ten times that of a legacy router, 
while driving the price down to as little as a tenth. This cost comparison does 
not include the lower training costs for Layer 3 switch administrators or the 
increased productivity of a high-performance network. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">There is another major architectural difference between a 
Layer 3 switch and a router. A traditional router organizes bridging (Layer 2) 
and routing (Layer 3) as peers. A Layer 3 switch layers routing on top of 
switching, permitting a more natural networking architecture while greatly 
facilitating scalability.</font></p>

</a><a target="main" name="Switch">
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>The Business Case for a Layer 3 Switch</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Some IT managers may be concerned about deploying a &quot;new&quot; technology such as 
Layer 3 switching to their network. But Layer 3 switching is really an 
integration of two proven technologies: switching and routing. In fact, some 
Layer 3 switches are running the exact same routing software that has been fully 
tested and used in mission-critical networks for nearly a decade. So whether the 
decision maker is an early adopter of technology or more conservative, the Layer 
3 switch can satisfy both needs. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The first step toward the deployment of next-generation IT 
infrastructures is to ignore the networking element. Although this may seem 
absurd, it allows managers to focus on the end users, services, and data without 
being bound by historical network deficiencies. The network should be 
transparent. When the requirements for information transfer are known, capacity 
planning techniques will determine the necessary client and server 
interconnects. Organizational and security mandates are then applied, yielding 
the policy and subnetted infrastructure. Cost is then factored in. Finally, the 
decision is made regarding the appropriate networking products to satisfy these 
requirements. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Layer 3 switching technology must be considered from two 
perspectives. First, as a migration tool to move users forward to 
higher-performance networking, or surprisingly, to squeeze more performance out 
of what is currently installed. Many users complain about FDDI performance, only 
to discover that the network is running at less than 20 percent of capacity. The 
problem is not the network, but rather the devices attached to it. The second 
perspective addresses what can be done when network performance bottlenecks are 
removed. A high-performance network enables a variety of steps to reduce costs 
and enhance security and business operations. The following are examples of 
several such steps. </font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Server farms</b>. Today, the viability of many 
  organizations is closely related to their intellectual property, often stored 
  on databases or server devices. The security and protection of these servers 
  has been a major goal of IT managers, who have been at odds with the users of 
  those servers. The point of contention has been the dependence of server 
  performance on the network topology. The response has been to move servers 
  within the same subnet or Layer 2 switching domain as users. With data traffic 
  patterns becoming more distributed, this approach was breaking down. The Layer 
  3 switch allows servers to be centralized with no performance penalty, 
  eliminating the cost of numerous server repositories while keeping end users 
  satisfied. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Intranets</b>. Because of its secure nature, along 
  with its higher capacity, the intranet is becoming a viable corporate 
  communications vehicle with usage that includes HR record retrieval, major 
  announcements, computer-based training, and live video broadcasts. Delivering 
  a wide variety of services, some requiring a huge amount of bandwidth, can 
  wreak havoc on the old router. The Layer 3 switch, because of its higher 
  performance, traffic prioritization, and subnet preservation, is ideally 
  suited for the deployment of intranets. </font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Converged networks</b>. For some time, technological 
  prognosticators have been extolling the virtues of multimedia and warning of 
  the excessive demand it will place on IT infrastructures. But many network 
  managers have been disinclined to integrate their voice, video, and data 
  traffic, concerned not only with the bandwidth requirements, but fearing the 
  degraded quality of the respective elements. The ability to recognize and 
  respond to the unique attributes of voice, data, and video not only makes 
  their integration viable, but also attractive from a cost and management 
  perspective. The inherent flow recognition capabilities of Layer 3 switching 
  enable practical deployment of converged networks without performance 
  uncertainties. </font></li>
</ul>
</a>
<p align="justify"><a target="main" name="cost"><font face="Arial"><b><i>Cost Savings</i></b></font></a></p>
<p align="justify"><a target="main" name="cost"><font face="Arial">A traditional router may run U.S. $8,000 to $10,000 per Fast Ethernet interface, 
while a Layer 3 switch costs less than U.S. $1,000 per port. Surprisingly, 
greater densities can be achieved with Layer 3 switching, freeing up valuable 
rack space and saving on physical cabling plant expansion. Training costs 
plummet, too, as a four- to seven-day legacy router course is replaced with a 
one- or two-day class for the Layer 3 switch. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Major savings also lie in the ancillary effects of 
applying Layer 3 switching technology. Cost savings realized through server 
centralization, notably in physical plant and security, can be substantial, 
especially when space is at a premium. Other, less tangible effects include 
improved response time and conformance with SLAs. Clearly, the overall cost of 
ownership benefits of Layer 3 switches versus routers can be substantial.</font></p>
