X-25 data link layer</span></font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">X.25</span> is an 
International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) 
protocol standard for WAN communications that defines how connections between 
user devices and network devices are established and maintained. X.25 is 
designed to operate effectively regardless of the type of systems connected to 
the network. It is typically used in the packet-switched networks (PSNs) of 
common carriers, such as the telephone companies. Subscribers are charged based 
on their use of the network. The development of the X.25 standard was initiated 
by the common carriers in the 1970s. At that time, there was a need for WAN 
protocols capable of providing connectivity across public data networks (PDNs). 
X.25 is now administered as an international standard by the ITU-T. </font></p>
<h2 class="p_H_Head1"><font face="Arial">X.25 Devices and Protocol Operation
</font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">X.25 network devices fall into three 
general categories: data terminal equipment (DTE), data circuit-terminating 
equipment (DCE), and packet-switching exchange (PSE). Data terminal equipment 
devices are end systems that communicate across the X.25 network. They are 
usually terminals, personal computers, or network hosts, and are located on the 
premises of individual subscribers. DCE devices are communications devices, such 
as modems and packet switches, that provide the interface between DTE devices 
and a PSE, and are generally located in the carrier's facilities. PSEs are 
switches that compose the bulk of the carrier's network. They transfer data from 
one DTE device to another through the X.25 PSN. Figure 17-1 illustrates the 
relationships among the three types of X.25 network devices. </font></p>

<h3 class="p_H_Head2"><font face="Arial">Packet Assembler/Disassembler </font>
</h3>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">The
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">packet assembler/disassembler 
(PAD)</span> is a device commonly found in X.25 networks. PADs are used when a 
DTE device, such as a character-mode terminal, is too simple to implement the 
full X.25 functionality. The PAD is located between a DTE device and a DCE 
device, and it performs three primary functions: buffering (storing data until a 
device is ready to process it), packet assembly, and packet disassembly. The PAD 
buffers data sent to or from the DTE device. It also assembles outgoing data 
into packets and forwards them to the DCE device. (This includes adding an X.25 
header.) Finally, the PAD disassembles incoming packets before forwarding the 
data to the DTE. (This includes removing the X.25 header.) Figure 17-2 
illustrates the basic operation of the PAD when receiving packets from the X.25 
WAN. </font></p>

<h3 class="p_H_Head2"><font face="Arial">X.25 Session Establishment </font></h3>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">X.25 sessions are established when one 
DTE device contacts another to request a communication session. The DTE device 
that receives the request can either accept or refuse the connection. If the 
request is accepted, the two systems begin full-duplex information transfer. 
Either DTE device can terminate the connection. After the session is terminated, 
any further communication requires the establishment of a new session. </font>
</p>
<h3 class="p_H_Head2"><font face="Arial">X.25 Virtual Circuits </font></h3>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">A
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">virtual circuit</span> is 
a logical connection created to ensure reliable communication between two 
network devices. A virtual circuit denotes the existence of a logical, 
bidirectional path from one DTE device to another across an X.25 network. 
Physically, the connection can pass through any number of intermediate nodes, 
such as DCE devices and PSEs. Multiple virtual circuits (logical connections) 
can be multiplexed onto a single physical circuit (a physical connection). 
Virtual circuits are demultiplexed at the remote end, and data is sent to the 
appropriate destinations. Figure 17-3 illustrates four separate virtual circuits 
being multiplexed onto a single physical circuit. </font></p>

Multiplexed onto a Single Physical Circuit</font></p>

  <font face="Arial">
  <img id="wp1020576" height="179" hspace="0" src="ct841703.jpg" width="552" border="0"></font></div>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Two types of X.25 virtual circuits 
exist: switched and permanent.
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Switched virtual circuits</span>
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">(SVCs)</span> are 
temporary connections used for sporadic data transfers. They require that two 
DTE devices establish, maintain, and terminate a session each time the devices 
need to communicate.<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic"> 
Permanent virtual circuits (PVCs)</span> are permanently established connections 
used for frequent and consistent data transfers. PVCs do not require that 
sessions be established and terminated. Therefore, DTEs can begin transferring 
data whenever necessary because the session is always active. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">The basic operation of an X.25 virtual 
circuit begins when the source DTE device specifies the virtual circuit to be 
used (in the packet headers) and then sends the packets to a locally connected 
DCE device. At this point, the local DCE device examines the packet headers to 
determine which virtual circuit to use and then sends the packets to the closest 
PSE in the path of that virtual circuit. PSEs (switches) pass the traffic to the 
next intermediate node in the path, which may be another switch or the remote 
DCE device. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">When the traffic arrives at the remote 
DCE device, the packet headers are examined and the destination address is 
determined. The packets are then sent to the destination DTE device. If 
communication occurs over an SVC and neither device has additional data to 
transfer, the virtual circuit is terminated. </font></p>
<h2 class="p_H_Head1"><font face="Arial">The X.25 Protocol Suite </font></h2>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">The X.25 protocol suite maps to the 
lowest three layers of the OSI reference model. The following protocols are 
typically used in X.25 implementations: Packet-Layer Protocol (PLP), Link Access 
Procedure, Balanced (LAPB), and those among other physical-layer serial 
interfaces (such as EIA/TIA-232, EIA/TIA-449, EIA-530, and G.703). Figure 17-4 
maps the key X.25 protocols to the layers of the OSI reference model. </font>

<h3 class="p_H_Head2"><font face="Arial">Packet-Layer Protocol </font></h3>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">PLP</span> is the X.25 
network layer protocol. PLP manages packet exchanges between DTE devices across 
virtual circuits. PLPs also can run over Logical Link Control 2 (LLC2) 
implementations on LANs and over Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) 
interfaces running Link Access Procedure on the D channel (LAPD). </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">The PLP operates in five distinct modes: 
call setup, data transfer, idle, call clearing, and restarting. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Call setup mode is used to establish 
SVCs between DTE devices. A PLP uses the X.121 addressing scheme to set up the 
virtual circuit. The call setup mode is executed on a per-virtual-circuit basis, 
which means that one virtual circuit can be in call setup mode while another is 
in data transfer mode. This mode is used only with SVCs, not with PVCs. </font>
</p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Data transfer mode is used for 
transferring data between two DTE devices across a virtual circuit. In this 
mode, PLP handles segmentation and reassembly, bit padding, and error and flow 
control. This mode is executed on a per-virtual-circuit basis and is used with 
both PVCs and SVCs. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Idle mode is used when a virtual circuit 
is established but data transfer is not occurring. <br>
It is executed on a per-virtual-circuit basis and is used only with SVCs. </font>
</p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Call clearing mode is used to end 
communication sessions between DTE devices and to terminate SVCs. This mode is 
executed on a per-virtual-circuit basis and is used only with SVCs. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Restarting mode is used to synchronize 
transmission between a DTE device and a locally connected DCE device. This mode 
is not executed on a per-virtual-circuit basis. It affects all the DTE device's 
established virtual circuits. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Four types of PLP packet fields exist:
</font></p>
<p class="pBu1_Bullet1"><font face="Arial">•<img height="2" src="blank.gif" width="19" border="0"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal">General 
Format Identifier (GFI)</span>—Identifies packet parameters, such as whether the

<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">LAPB</span> is a data link 
layer protocol that manages communication and packet framing between DTE and DCE 
devices. LAPB is a bit-oriented protocol that ensures that frames are correctly 
ordered and error-free. </font></p>
<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">Three types of LAPB frames exist: 
information, supervisory, and unnumbered. The information frame (I-frame) 
carries upper-layer information and some control information. I-frame functions 
include sequencing, flow control, and error detection and recovery. I-frames 
carry send- and receive-sequence numbers. The supervisory frame (S-frame) 
carries control information. S-frame functions include requesting and suspending 
transmissions, reporting on status, and acknowledging the receipt of I-frames. 
S-frames carry only receive-sequence numbers. The unnumbered frame (U frame) 
carries control information. U-frame functions include link setup and 
disconnection, as well as error reporting. U frames carry no sequence numbers.

<p class="pB1_Body1"><font face="Arial">
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">X.21bis</span> is a 
physical layer protocol used in X.25 that defines the electrical and mechanical

deactivation of the physical medium connecting DTE and DCE devices. It supports 
point-to-point connections, speeds up to 19.2 kbps, and synchronous, full-duplex 
transmission over four-wire media. Figure 17-5 shows the format of the PLP 
packet and its relationship to the LAPB frame and the X.21bis frame. </font></p>
