<p><font face="Arial">A <b>communications satellite</b> (sometimes abbreviated 
to <b>comsat</b>) is an artificial satellite stationed in space 
for the purposes of telecommunications. Modern 
communications satellites use geosynchronous orbits, Molniya orbits or low polar Earth orbits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Satellite communication became a possibility when it was 
realised (by the science fiction writer, Arthur C. Clarke) that a satellite 
orbiting at a distance of <b>36000Km</b> from the Earth would be <b>
geostationary</b>, i.e. would have an angular orbital velocity equal to the 
Earth's own orbital velocity. It would thus appear to remain stationary relative 
to the Earth if placed in an equatorial orbit. This is a consequence of Kepler's 
law that the period of rotation T of a satellite around the Earth was given by:

<p><font face="Arial">where <b>r</b> is the orbit radius, <b>R</b> is the 
Earth's radius and
<img alt src="img234.gif" align="middle" width="101" height="26"> is the 
acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface. As the orbit increases in 
radius, the angular velocity reduces, until it is coincident with the Earth's at 
a radius of <b>36000Km</b>. In principle, three geostationary satellites 
correctly placed can provide complete coverage of the Earth's surface.

<p><font face="Arial">For intercontinental communication, satellite radio links 
become a commercially attractive proposition. Space communication showed 
phenomenal growth in the 1970s, and will continue to grow for some years to 
come. The growth has been so rapid that there is now danger of overcrowding the 
geostationary orbit. Satellite communication has a number of advantages: </font>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">The laying and maintenance of intercontinental cable is 
  difficult and expensive. </font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The heavy usage of intercontinental traffic makes the 
  satellite commercially attractive. </font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Satellites can cover large areas of the Earth. This is 
  particularly useful for sparsely populated areas. </font>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial">Satellite communication is limited by four factors: </font>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial">Technological limitations preventing the deployment of 
  large, high gain antennas on the satellite platform. </font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Over-crowding of available bandwidths due to low 
  antenna gains. </font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The high investment cost and insurance cost associated 
  with significant probability of failure. </font>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Arial">High atmospheric losses above 30GHz limit carrier 
  frequencies. </font>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial">A microwave antenna has two functions. It provides <b>gain</b> 
(i.e. amplification). It also directs the radiation into confined regions of 
space: the <b>antenna beam</b>. These properties are largely dependent on the 
antenna size. For a circular, dish antenna, the gain <b>G</b> is related to the 
antenna area <b>A</b> by the formula: </font></p>
<p><a name="equdishGain"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></a><font face="Arial"><img alt src="img236.gif" align="bottom" width="500" height="19">
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">where
<img alt src="img237.gif" align="bottom" width="8" height="11"> is the 
wavelength of the transmitted carrier. The angular width of the antenna beam
<img alt src="img238.gif" align="bottom" width="10" height="12"> is related to 
the antenna radius <b>R</b> by: </font></p>
<p><a name="equbeamWidth"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></a><font face="Arial"><img alt src="img239.gif" align="bottom" width="500" height="17">
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Thus, large antennas have high gains and narrow beams. </font>
</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> </font><a name="figantennabeam"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></a><font face="Arial"> 
A typical antenna beam profile of a dish antenna<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The cost of constructing an antenna is a strong function 
of its size. A rough rule of thumb is the the cost is proportional to the 
diameter cubed. Thus a doubling of the antenna size will result in the satellite 
cost increasing eight times. As a result, antenna sizes are limited. The 
limitation in antenna size means that the satellite beam is wide. In order to 
prevent electromagnetic interference with terrestrial stations, the power 
radiated by the satellite is limited by international convention. In any event 
power is severely limited on a satellite platform. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Because the radiated power is low, large receiving 
antennas are required. The larger the receiver antenna, the larger the antenna 
gain, and hence the better the receiver SNR. The SNR is a function of the 
bandwidth, and the atmospheric attenuation. Ground stations close to the poles 
of the Earth have low elevation <b>look angles</b>, and signals have to pass 
through a thicker section of atmosphere. The size of receiver antenna is 
determined by the two requirements; 500MHz receive bandwidth and full capability 
at <img alt src="img241.gif" align="middle" width="32" height="24"> of latitude.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A standard INTELSAT receiver is 30m in diameter. An 
antenna this large has a very narrow beam, typically
<img alt src="img242.gif" align="bottom" width="32" height="13">. A 
geostationary satellite is not truly stationary, it wanders slightly in the sky. 
The very narrow beam width of the receiver requires automatic tracking of the 
satellite, and continuous pointing of the receiver antenna. An INTELSAT ground 
station is thus a large, expensive piece of equipment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Satellite systems are extremely expensive. As an example, 
the break down for a particular British satellite is as shown in Table. </font>

<strong>Table:</strong> Example costs for a satellite system<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The use of satellites for regional communication is 
possible if there is sufficient demand for traffic. By reducing the range of 
latitudes down to
<img alt src="img244.gif" align="middle" width="32" height="24">, and reducing 
the bandwidth down to 50MHz, large reductions in satellite and ground station 
receiver costs are possible. One such <b>direct-to-user (DTU)</b> system is the 
Satellite Business System (SBS) covering a range of business and governments 
users with a demand for high speed data links in the US. The region is split 
into areas, roughly coincident with the satellite antenna gain contours, 
denoting increased cost of receiver technology. It is important to realise that 
the economies of satellite communication only make this regional communication 
possible if the system is heavily used. </font>

<p><font face="Arial">Improvements in satellite receiver technology have 
permitted smaller antennas to be used as ground station receivers. However, 
antennas are reciprocal. They have the same directional characteristics in 
transmit and receive. The use of low gain, wide beam earth stations for DTU 
systems has contributed considerably to the bandwidth overcrowding problem, 
particularly in the US. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Recently there has been interest in <b>low-earth orbiting 
(LEO)</b> satellites. Here, a satellite placed in a <b>1000Km</b> orbit has an 
orbital time of 1 hour. These satellites can be operated in a <b>
store-and-forward</b> mode, picking up data at one part of the globe and 
physically transferring it to another. Because the data-rates and orbit radius 
are greatly reduced, small, low-cost satellites and ground stations are 
possible. However, such satellites have yet to demonstrate any commercial 
success.</font></p>
