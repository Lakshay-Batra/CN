<p align="center"><u><b><font face="Arial" size="6" color="#FF0000">IEEE 802.15</font></b></u></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>IEEE 802.15</b> is the <b>15</b><sup>th</sup> working 
group of the IEEE 802 and specializes in Wireless PAN (Personal Area Network) 
standards. It includes seven task groups (numbered from 1 to 7):</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">Task group 1 (WPAN/Bluetooth)</span></font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">IEEE 802.15.1-2002 has derived a Wireless Personal Area 
Network standard based on the Bluetooth v1.1 specifications. It includes a media 
access control and physical layer specification. An updated version of this 
standard, based upon the additions incorporated into Bluetooth v1.2, was 
published as IEEE 802.15.1-2005. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Following the publication of 802.15.1-2005, the IEEE Study 
Group 1b voted 90-0 to discontinue their relationship with the Bluetooth SIG, 
effectively meaning that the later versions of Bluetooth will not become future 
IEEE standards.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">Task group 2 
(Coexistence)</span></font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">IEEE 802.15.2-2003 addresses the issue of coexistence of 
wireless personal area networks (WPAN) with other wireless devices operating in 
unlicensed frequency bands such as wireless local area networks (WLAN).</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">Task group 3 (High 
Rate WPAN)</span></font></h2>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">3 (High Rate WPAN)</span></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">IEEE 802.15.3-2003 is a MAC and PHY standard for high-rate 
(11 to 55 Mbit/s) WPANs.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">3a (WPAN High Rate 
Alternative PHY)</span></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">IEEE 802.15.3a was an attempt to provide a higher speed 
UWB PHY enhancement amendment to IEEE 802.15.3 for applications which involve 
imaging and multimedia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The IEEE 802.15.3a most commendable achievement was the 
consolidation of 23 UWB PHY specifications into two proposals using&nbsp;: Multi-Band 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB, supported by the 
WiMedia Alliance, and Direct Sequence - UWB (DS-UWB), supported by the UWB 
Forum.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On January 19, 2006 IEEE 802.15.3a task group (TG3a) 
members voted to withdraw the December 2002 project authorization request (PAR) 
that initiated the development of high data rate UWB standards. The process was 
in total deadlock. There were two technology proposals on the table backed by 
two different industry alliances. One of them was backed by the majority of the 
industry; the other was only supported by a small minority but had sufficient 
votes to block forward progress. The task group finally agreed to duke it out in 
the market place. The Working Group concurred. The technology at the time also 
faced significant regulatory hurdles, that have been resolved in 2008. This was 
not a factor in this decision but from a standards perspective it probably was 
too early to write a UWB standard. The main proposal was adopted by the WiMedia 
Alliance, and eventually by the USB-IF and Bluetooth SIG.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">3b (MAC Amendment)</span></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The IEEE 802.15.3.b is working on an amendment to 802.15.3 
to improve implementation and interoprability of the MAC. This will include 
minor optimizations while preserving backward compatibility. In addition, this 
amendment will correct errors, clarify ambiguities, and add editorial 
clarifications.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">3c (WPAN Millimeter 
Wave Alternative PHY)</span></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The IEEE 802.15.3 Task Group 3c (TG3c) was formed in March 
2005. TG3c is developing a millimeter-wave-based alternative physical layer (PHY) 
for the existing 802.15.3 Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) Standard 
802.15.3-2003. Standard completion is expected for May 2008.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This mmWave WPAN will operate in the new and clear band 
including 57-64 GHz unlicensed band defined by FCC 47 CFR 15.255. The 
millimeter-wave WPAN will allow high coexistence (close physical spacing) with 
all other microwave systems in the 802.15 family of WPANs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In addition, the millimeter-wave WPAN will allow very high 
data rate over 2 Gbit/s applications such as high speed internet access, 
streaming content download (video on demand, HDTV, home theater, etc.), real 
time streaming and wireless data bus for cable replacement. Optional data rates 
in excess of 3 Gbit/s will be provided.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">Task group 4 (Low Rate 
WPAN)</span></font></h2>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">4 (Low Rate WPAN) 
ZigBee</span></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">IEEE 802.15.4-2003 (Low Rate WPAN) deals with low data 
rate but very long battery life (months or even years) and very low complexity. 
The first edition of the 802.15.4 standard was released in May 2003. In March 
2004, after forming Task Group 4b, task group 4 put itself in hibernation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The ZigBee set of high level communication protocols is 
based upon the specification produced by the IEEE 802.15.4 task group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) 6LoWPAN working 
group is working to specify methods for performing IPv6 networking over IEEE 
802.15.4 networks. They have released RFC 4919 describing &quot;the assumptions, 
problem statement, and goals for transmitting IP over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.&quot; 
In September 2007 the 6LoWPAN working group released the RFC 4944 which defines 
the 6LoWPAN header compression scheme. Also in the IETF 70 held in December of 
2007 at Vancouver a BoF was held to determine if a new working group should be 
established to work on a standard routing solution for 6LoWPAN. The new working 
group was decided to be formed and was named ROLL (Routing Over Lossy and 
Low-power links). First ROLL WG meeting was held in IETF 72.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">4a (WPAN Low Rate 
Alternative PHY)</span></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">The principal interest is in providing communications and 
high precision ranging / location capability (1 meter accuracy and better), high 
aggregate throughput, and ultra low power; as well as adding scalability to data 
rates, longer range, and lower power consumption and cost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In March 2005, IEEE802.15.4a selected a baseline 
specification. The baseline is two optional PHYs consisting of a UWB Pulse Radio 
(operating in unlicensed UWB spectrum) and a Chirp Spread Spectrum (operating in 
unlicensed 2.4GHz spectrum). The Pulsed UWB Radio is based on Continuous Pulsed 
UWB technology (see C-UWB) and will be able to deliver communications and high 
precision ranging. In March 2007, 802.15.4a was approved as an amendment to IEEE 
Std 802.15.4-2006. </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">4b (Revisions and 
Enhancements)</span></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The IEEE 802.15 task group 4b was chartered to create a 
project for specific enhancements and clarifications to the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 
standard, such as resolving ambiguities, reducing unnecessary complexity, 
increasing flexibility in security key usage, considerations for newly available 
frequency allocations, and others. IEEE 802.15.4b was approved in June 2006 and 
was published in September 2006 as IEEE 802.15.4-2006.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Mesh Networking of Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs)</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="3"><span class="mw-headline">Task Group 6 (BAN)</span></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This task group is focusing on BAN or Body Area Network 
Technologies. The goal is a low-power and low-frequency short-range wireless 
standard. </font></p>

            <P><font face="Arial"><B>IEEE 802.15 and Bluetooth: WPAN Communications</B></font></P>
            <P><font face="Arial">IEEE 802.15, a standardization of Bluetooth wireless 
            specification defined by IEEE, is for wireless personal area 
            networks (WPANs). IEEE 802.15 has characters such as short-range, 
            low power, low cost, small networks and communication of devices 
            within a Personal Operating Space. </font> </P>
            <P><font face="Arial">The initial version, IEEE 802.15.1, was adapted from the 
            Bluetooth specification and is fully compatible with Bluetooth 1.1. 
            Bluetooth becomes widely used specification for wireless 
            communications among portable digital devices including notebook 
            computers, peripherals, cellular telephones, beepers, and consumer 
            electronic devices. The specification also allows for connection to 
            the Internet. 802.15.1/Bluetooth specify standards in on the 
            Physical layer and Data link layer of the OSI model with the 
            following four sub-layers:</font></P>
            <P><font face="Arial">RF layer: The air interface is based on antenna power range 
            starting from 0 dBm up to 20 dBm. Bluetooth operates in the 2.4 GHz 
            band and the link range is anywhere from 10 centimeters to 10 
            meters. </font> </P>
            <P><font face="Arial">Baseband layer: establishes the Bluetooth physical link between 
            devices forming a piconet -- a network of devices connected in an ad 
            hoc fashion using Bluetooth technology. </font> </P>
            <P><font face="Arial">Link manager: sets up the link between Bluetooth devices. Other 
            functions of the link manager include security, negotiation of 
            Baseband packet sizes, power mode and duty cycle control of the 
            Bluetooth device, and the connection states of a Bluetooth device in 
            a piconet. </font> </P>
            <P><font face="Arial">Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP): provides 
            the upper layer protocols with connectionless and 
            connection-oriented services. </font> </P>
            <P><font face="Arial">The IEEE 802.15 Working Groups are making progress to improve the 
            Bluetooth standards. They proposed two general categories of 802.15: 
            the low rate 802.15.4 (TG4) and high rate 802.15.3 (TG3). The TG4 
            version provides data speeds of 20 Kbps or 250 Kbps, low power and 
            low cost solutions. The TG3 version supports data speeds ranging 20 
            Mbps or greater, for multi-media applications. </font> </P>
<p><font face="Arial">IEEE 
            802.15/Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11/WLAN and IEEE 802.16/WiMAX 
            technologies are complementary to each other and each play a unique 
            role in today's wireless communications. The following table
