<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In 10/100 and Gigabit Ethernet, the MAC 
layer works in a linear manner - data moves serially in and out of the MAC layer 
with all the starting and ending control messages (including clocking and 
synchronization) embedded inside the datastream. With 10G Ethernet, it is much 
more complex.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">To attain a 10G bit/sec bandwidth rate, 
the IEEE altered the way that MAC layer interprets signaling. Rather than 
producing a serial stream, the 10G Ethernet layer operates in parallel to 
interpret data. The transmit and receive paths each comprise four data lanes, 
and the datastream broken down into bytes is handled in round-robin fashion 
across the four lanes, numbered 0 to 3. On the transmit path, for example, the 
first byte aligns to Lane 0, the second byte to Lane 1, the third byte to Lane 
2, the fourth byte to Lane 3, the fifth byte back to Lane 0, and so on. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ethernet frames have clearly defined 
beginning and ending boundaries, or delimiters. These are marked by special 
characters and a 12-byte interpacket gap (IPG) that dictates the minimum amount 
of space or idle time between packets. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Because of the parallel nature of the 10G 
Ethernet MAC layer, it is impossible to predict the lane in which the ending 
byte of the previous datastream will fall. This makes finding the starting bit - 
a requirement for maintaining timing and synchronization - more difficult. The 
802.3ae standard mandated an elegant solution: the &quot;start control character,&quot; or 
very first byte of a new data frame, must always align on Lane 0. However, this 
solution complicates the way the MAC handles the IPG, directly affecting 
performance. Nevertheless, the IEEE provided three options for the vendors to 
address this issue: 1) pad (increase), 2) shrink, or 3) average the &quot;minimum&quot; 
IPG. </font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Padding increases the IPG</font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If the ending character of the previous 
packet falls into 12th slot in the 12-byte IPG, the MAC layer does nothing and 
maintains the 12-byte minimum IPG, and the starting character of the next packet 
automatically aligns in Position A of Lane 0. If, however, the ending character 
of the previous packet falls into other positions, the MAC layer must add bytes 
respectively into the IPG to ensure that the starting character of the next 
packet aligns properly in Position A of Lane 0. This results in a minimum IPG 
that ranges from 12 to 15 bytes (12-byte minimum plus additional pad). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Increasing the size of the IPG beyond the 
12-byte minimum decreases the available bandwidth on the 10G Ethernet link by as 
much as 10%, depending on packet size. </font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Shrinking the IPG</font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">After padding bytes to the IPG to ensure 
the starting character aligns to Position A, the MAC eliminates the middle 
column of idle characters. This results in an IPG that ranges from eight to 11 
bytes (12-byte minimum plus padding minus the four idle bytes). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Decreasing the 10G Ethernet IPG by 
eliminating the middle column of idle bytes provides an additional 5% available 
bandwidth on the 10G Ethernet link, depending on packet size. </font></p>
<h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="3">Averaging the IPG</font></h3>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">This option uses a combination of options 
1 and 3 with the addition of a deficit idle counter, which keeps track of the 
number of added or deleted idle bytes (ranging from 0 to 3). In some cases, the 
MAC layer will add and, in others, eliminate bytes. Over the long run, the net 
result will be an average 12-byte minimum 10G Ethernet IPG. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Averaging the 10G Ethernet IPG ensures 
that the port delivers 100% of the available bandwidth and lets the connection 
maintain zero-loss line-rate performance. </font></p>

The <b>10 Gigabit Ethernet</b> or <b>10GE</b> or <b>10GbE</b> or <b>10 GigE</b> 
standard was first published in 2002 as IEEE Std 802.3ae-2002 and is the fastest 
of the Ethernet standards. It defines a version of Ethernet with a nominal data 
rate of 10 Gbit/s, ten times faster than Gigabit Ethernet.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Over the years 
the following 802.3 standards relating to 10GbE have been published: 
802.3ae-2002 (fiber -SR, -LR, -ER and -LX4 PMDs), 802.3ak-2004 (-CX4 copper 
twin-ax InfiniBand type cable), 802.3an-2006 (10GBASE-T copper twisted pair), 
802.3ap-2007 (copper backplane -KR and -KX4 PMDs) and 802.3aq-2006 (fiber -LRM 
PMD with enhanced equalization).</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
802.3ae-2002 and 802.3ak-2004 amendments were consolidated into the IEEE 
802.3-2005 standard. IEEE 802.3-2005 and the other amendments have been 
consolidated into IEEE Std 802.3-2008.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">10 Gigabit 
Ethernet supports only full duplex links which can be connected by switches. 
Half Duplex operation and CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access with collision 
detect) are not supported in 10GbE.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The 10 Gigabit 
Ethernet standard encompasses a number of different physical layer (PHY) 
standards. As of 2008 10 Gigabit Ethernet is still an emerging technology with 
only 1 million ports shipped in 2007, and it remains to be seen which of the 
PHYs will gain widespread commercial acceptance. A networking device may support 
different PHY types by means of pluggable PHY modules.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">At the time 
the 10 Gigabit Ethernet standards were developed there was much interest in 
10GbE as a WAN transport and this led to the introduction of the concept of the 
WAN PHY for 10GbE. This operates at a slightly slower data-rate than the LAN PHY 
and adds some extra encapsulation. The WAN PHY and LAN PHY are specified to 
share the same PMDs (Physical Medium Dependent) so 10GBASE-LR and 10GBASE-LW can 
use the same optics. In terms of number of ports shipped the LAN PHY greatly 
outsells the WAN PHY.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Optical 
modules are not specified in 802.3 but by multi-source agreements (MSAs). The 
relevant MSAs for 10GbE are XENPAK, X2, XPAK, XFP and SFP+.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">When choosing 
a PHY module consideration should be given to cost, reach, media type, power 
consumption and size (form factor).</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">In the case of 
SFP+ consideration also has to be given to whether the module is linear or 
limiting. Linear SFP+ modules are appropriate for 10GBASE-LRM otherwise limiting 
modules are preferred. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">XENPAK was the 
first MSA for 10GE and has the largest form factor.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">X2 and XPAK 
were later competing standards with smaller form factors. X2 and XPAK have not 
been as successful in the market as XENPAK.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">XFP came after 
X2 and XPAK and is smaller.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The newest 
module standard SFP+ (see SFP transceiver) developed by the ANSI T11 fibre 
channel group is smaller still and lower power than XFP. It is hoped that SFP+ 
will enable lower cost 10GE optical modules to be produced. SFP+ modules do only 
optical to electrical conversion, no clock and data recovery, putting a higher 
burden on the host's channel equalization. SFP+ modules share a common physical 
form factor with legacy SFP modules, allowing higher port density than XFP and 
the re-use of existing designs for 24 or 48 ports in a 19&quot; rack width blade.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Optical 
modules are connected to a host by either a XAUI, XFI or SFI interface.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">XENPAK, X2, 
and XPAK modules use XAUI to connect to their hosts. XAUI (XGXS) uses a 
four-lane data channel and is specified in IEEE 802.3 Clause 48.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">XFP modules 
use a XFI interface and SFP+ modules use a SFI interface. XFI and SFI use a 
single lane data channel and the encoding specified in IEEE 802.3 Clause 49.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">There 
are two classifications for optical fiber: single-mode (SMF) and multi-mode (MMF). 
In SMF light follows a single path through the fiber while in MMF it takes 
multiple paths resulting in differential mode delay (DMD). SMF is used for long 
distance communication and MMF is used for distances of less than 300 m. SMF has 
a narrower core (8.3&nbsp;µm) which makes connecting fibers more difficult. MMF has a 
wider core (50 or 62.5&nbsp;µm) and is more expensive than SMF. The advantage of MMF 
for short distances is that because of its wider core it can be driven by lower 
cost lasers and its connectors are cheaper and more reliable. Its disadvantage 
is that due to DMD it can work only over short distances. To distinguish SMF 
from MMF cables, SMF cables are usually yellow, while MMF cables are orange.
</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">New structured 
cabling installations use OM3 50&nbsp;µm MMF which has no center defect. OM3 cable

(PAM-16), encoded in a two-dimensional checkerboard pattern known as DSQ128. 
Several proposals were considered for wire-level modulation, including PAM with 
12 discrete levels (PAM-12), 10 levels (PAM-10), or 8 levels (PAM-8), both with 
and without Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP). PAM-5 is what is used in the 
older 1000BASE-T gigabit Ethernet standard.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">10GBASE-SW, 
10GBASE-LW, 10GBASE-EW, and 10GBASE-ZW are varieties that use the WAN PHY, 
designed to interoperate with OC-192/STM-64 SDH/SONET equipment using a 
light-weight SDH/SONET frame running at 9.953 Gbit/s. WAN PHY is used when an 
enterprise user wishes to transport 10G Ethernet across telco SDH/SONET or 
previously installed WDM systems without having to directly map the Ethernet 
frames into SDH/SONET. The WAN PHY variants correspond at the physical layer to 
10GBASE-SR, 10GBASE-LR, 10GBASE-ER and 10GBASE-ZR respectively, and hence use 
the same types of fiber and support the same distances. There is no WAN PHY 
standard corresponding to 10GBASE-LX4 and 10GBASE-CX4 since the original SONET/SDH 
standard requires a serial implementation. The WAN PHYs use 10GBASE-W as the 
PCS.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">A number of 
vendors are offering products based on Dense wavelength-division multiplexing, 
which allows packing up to 4 light carriers into one single-mode optical fiber, 
effectively providing 40 Gigabit operation. These products are not related to 
the upcoming 40 Gigabit Ethernet standard, which will provide 40 Gigabit 
operation using a single light carrier.</span></p>
