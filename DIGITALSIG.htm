SIGNATURE</b></font></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">A digital signature (not to be confused with a 
digital certificate) is an electronic signature that can be used to authenticate 
the identity of the sender of a message or the signer of a document, and 
possibly to ensure that the original content of the message or document that has 
been sent is unchanged. Digital signatures are easily transportable, cannot be 
imitated by someone else, and can be automatically time-stamped. The ability to 
ensure that the original signed message arrived means that the sender cannot 
easily repudiate it later. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial">A digital 
signature can be used with any kind of message, whether it is
<term>encrypted</term> or not, simply so that the receiver can be sure of the 
sender's identity and that the message arrived intact. A digital certificate 
contains the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority so that 
anyone can verify that the certificate is real. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">How It Works</span></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">Assume you were going to send the draft of a 
contract to your lawyer in another town. You want to give your lawyer the 
assurance that it was unchanged from what you sent and that it is really from 
you. </span></p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">You copy-and-paste the contract (it's a short 
  one!) into an e-mail note. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Using special software, you obtain a message 
  hash (mathematical summary) of the contract. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">You then use a private key that you have 
  previously obtained from a public-private key authority to encrypt the hash.
  </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">The encrypted hash becomes your digital 
  signature of the message. (Note that it will be different each time you send a 
  message.) </span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">At the other end, your lawyer receives the 
message. </span></p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">To make sure it's intact and from you, your 
  lawyer makes a hash of the received message. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Your lawyer then uses your public key to 
  decrypt the message hash or summary. </span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial">If the hashes match, the received message is 
valid.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">A <b>digital signature</b> is 
basically a way to ensure that an electronic document (e-mail, spreadsheet, text 
file, etc.) is <b>authentic</b>. Authentic means that you know who created the 
document and you know that it has not been altered in any way since that person 
created it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
Digital signatures rely on certain types of <b>encryption</b> to ensure 
authentication. Encryption is the process of taking all the data that one 
computer is sending to another and encoding it into a form that only the other 
computer will be able to decode. Authentication is the process of verifying that 
information is coming from a trusted source. These two processes work hand in 
hand for digital signatures. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">
There are several ways to authenticate a person or information on a computer:
</span></p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-align: justify"><b>
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Password</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
  - The use of a user name and password provide the most common form of 
  authentication. You enter your name and password when prompted by the 
  computer. It checks the pair against a secure file to confirm. If either the 
  name or password do not match, then you are not allowed further access. </span>
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-align: justify"><b>
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Checksum</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
  - Probably one of the oldest methods of ensuring that data is correct, 
  checksums also provide a form of authentication since an invalid checksum 
  suggests that the data has been compromised in some fashion. A checksum is 
  determined in one of two ways. Let's say the checksum of a packet is 1 byte 
  long, which means it can have a maximum value of 255. If the sum of the other 
  bytes in the packet is 255 or less, then the checksum contains that exact 
  value. However, if the sum of the other bytes is more than 255, then the 
  checksum is the remainder of the total value after it has been divided by 256. 
  Look at this example: </span></li>

  - CRCs are similar in concept to checksums but they use polynomial division to 
  determine the value of the CRC, which is usually 16 or 32 bits in length. The 
  good thing about CRC is that it is very accurate. If a single bit is 
  incorrect, the CRC value will not match up. Both checksum and CRC are good for 
  preventing random errors in transmission, but provide little protection from 
  an intentional attack on your data. The encryption techniques below are much

  <span style="font-family: Arial">Private key encryption</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
  -Private key means that each computer has a secret key (code) that it can use 
  to encrypt a packet of information before it is sent over the network to the 
  other computer. Private key requires that you know which computers will talk 
  to each other and install the key on each one. Private key encryption is 
  essentially the same as a secret code that the two computers must each know in 
  order to decode the information. The code would provide the key to decoding 
  the message. Think of it like this. You create a coded message to send to a 
  friend where each letter is substituted by the letter that is second from it. 
  So &quot;A&quot; becomes &quot;C&quot; and &quot;B&quot; becomes &quot;D&quot;. You have already told a trusted friend 
  that the code is &quot;Shift by 2&quot;. Your friend gets the message and decodes it. 
  Anyone else who sees the message will only see nonsense. </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-align: justify"><b>
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Public key encryption</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
  - Public key encryption uses a combination of a private key and a public key. 
  The private key is known only to your computer while the public key is given 
  by your computer to any computer that wants to communicate securely with it. 
  To decode an encrypted message, a computer must use the public key provided by 
  the originating computer and it's own private key. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">The key is based on a <b>hash 
value</b>. This is a value that is computed from a base input number using a <b>

nearly impossible to derive the original input number without knowing the data 
used to create the hash value. Here's a simple example: </span></p>

143. But if you knew that the multiplier was 143, then it would be very easy to 
calculate the value of 10667. Public key encryption is much more complex than 
this example but that is the basic idea. Public keys generally use complex 
algorithms and very large hash values for encrypting: 40-bit or even 128-bit 
numbers. A 128-bit number has a possible 2<sup>128</sup> different combinations. 
That's as many combinations as there are water molecules in 2.7 million olympic

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">Digital certificates</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black"> 
- To implement public key encryption on a large scale, such as a secure Web 
server might need, requires a different approach. This is where digital 
certificates come in. A digital certificate is essentially a bit of information 
that says the Web server is trusted by an independent source known as a <b>
Certificate Authority</b>. The Certificate Authority acts as the middleman that 
both computers trust. It confirms that each computer is in fact who they say 
they are and then provides the public keys of each computer to the other. </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial">A digital certificate is an electronic &quot;credit 
card&quot; that establishes your credentials when doing business or other 
transactions on the Web. It is issued by a certification authority (CA). It 
contains your name, a serial number, expiration dates, a copy of the certificate 
holder's public key (used for encrypting messages and digital signatures), and 
the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority so that a recipient 
can verify that the certificate is real. Some digital certificates conform to a 
standard, X.509. Digital certificates can be kept in registries so that 
authenticating users can look up other users' public keys.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">&nbsp;The <b>Digital Signature Standard (DSS)</b> is based on a type of public key 
encryption method that uses the <b>Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)</b>. DSS is 
the format for digital signatures that has been endorsed by the US government. 
The DSA algorithm consists of a private key that only the originator of the 
document (signer) knows and a public key. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>
<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="5">Benefits 
of Digital Signatures</font></span></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">There 
are three common reasons for applying a digital signature to communications:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Authentication</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Public-key cryptosystems allow encryption of a message with a user's private 
key. The message itself need not be sent in ciphertext. If a hash of the 
document is generated and and then protected via encryption, the document cannot 
be altered in any way without changing the hash to match, which, if quality 
algorithms are properly used, will be quite difficult. By decrypting the hash 
using the sender's public key, and checking the result against a newly generated 
hash of the alleged plaintext, the recipient can confirm (with high confidence) 
that the encryption was done with the sender's private key (and so presumably by 
the user who should have been the only person able to use that key), and that 
the message hasn't been altered since it was signed. No recipient can ever be 
absolutely certain the purported sender is indeed the signer -- ie, the person 
who used the private key -- since the cryptosystem might have been broken, the 
key copied, or the whole scheme evaded using social engineering.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">The 
importance of high confidence in both the message integrity and sender 
authenticity is especially obvious in a financial context. For example, suppose 
a bank's branch office sends instructions to the central office in the form <i>(a,b)</i> 
where <i>a</i> is the account number and <i>b</i> is the amount to be credited 
to the account. A devious customer may deposit £100, observe the resulting 
transmission and repeatedly retransmit <i>(a,b)</i>, getting a deposit each time 
and getting rich in the process. This is an example of a <i>replay attack</i>.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Integrity</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Both 
parties will always wish to be confident that a message has not been altered 
during transmission. Encryption of the message makes it difficult for a third 
party to <i>read</i> it, but that third party may still be able to <i>alter</i> 
it, perhaps maliciously, without actually reading it. An example is the <i>
homomorphism attack</i>: consider a bank which sends instructions from branch 
offices to the central office in the form <i>(a,b)</i> where <i>a</i> is the 
account number and <i>b</i> is the amount to be credited to the account. A 
devious customer may deposit £100, intercept the resulting transmission and then 
transmit <i>(a,b<sup>3</sup>)</i> to become an instant millionaire.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Non-repudiation</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">In a 
cryptographic context, the word <i>repudiation</i> refers to the act of 
disclaiming responsibility for a message (ie, claiming it was sent by some third 
party, certainly not me; 'I repudiate this message and its contents!&quot;). A 
message's recipient may insist the sender attach a signature in order to make 
later repudiation more difficult, since the recipient can show the signed 
message to a third party (eg, a court) to reinforce a claim as to its origin. 
However, loss of control over a user's private key will mean that all digitally 
signatures using that key, and so 'from' that user, are suspect. Noticing that 
such a loss of control has occurred is not a cryptographic problem, but a human 
space oen, and is unsolved. Short of special purpose protocols to address this 
issue, digital signatures alone cannot provide inherent non-repudiation.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Implementation of 
Public-key digital signatures</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Public-key digital signature schemes rely on public-key cryptography. In 
public-key cryptography, each user has a pair of keys: one public and one 
private. The public key is distributed freely, but the private key is kept 
secret by the user; another requirement is that it should be computationally 
infeasible to derive the private key from the public key.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Generally, digital signature schemes include three algorithms:</span></p>

example, consider a situation in which Bob sends a message to Alice and she 
wants to be certain it came from him. Bob sends his message to Alice, attaching 
a digital signature. The digital signature was generated using Bob's private 
key, and takes the form of a string of bits (normally represented as a string of 
characters (ie, digits and letters)). On receipt, Alice can then check whether 
the message really came from Bob by running the verification algorithm on the 
message together with the signature, using Bob's public key. If they match, then 
Alice can be confident the message really was from Bob, because quality digital 
signature algorithms are so designed that it is very difficult to forge a 
signature to match a given message (unless one has knowledge of the private key, 
which Bob must keep secret).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Digital signatures use encryption techniques but the algorithms are not 
typically suited for direct encryption of bulk plaintexts; more efficient 
methods are available. Of course a signed document may be sent encrypted over a 
public communication channel (eg, the Internet) just as might be any other 
message.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">More 
usually, Bob first applies a quality cryptographic hash function to the message, 
and then digitally signs the resulting hash (see diagram). An insecure hash can 
compromise the digital signature. For example, if it is possible to generate 
hash collisions, it might be feasible to forge digital signatures.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">There 
are several reasons to sign such a hash (or message digest) instead of the whole 
document.</span></p>

<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">In cryptography, a <b>cryptographic 
hash function</b> is a hash function with certain additional security properties 
to make it suitable for use as a primitive in various information security 
applications, such as authentication and message integrity. A hash function 
takes a long string (or message) of any length as input and produces a fixed 
length string as output, sometimes termed a <b>message digest</b> or a <b>
digital fingerprint</b>.</span></p>

<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Using separate key 
pairs for signing and encryption</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">In 
several countries, a digital signature has a status somewhat like that of a 
traditional pen and paper signature. Generally, these provisions mean that what 
is digitally signed legally binds the signer of the document to the terms 
therein. For that reason, it is often thought best to use separate key pairs for 
encrypting and signing. Using the encryption key pair a person can engage in an 
encrypted conversation (eg, about buying a house), but does not legally sign 
every message he sends. Only when both parties come to an agreement do they sign 
a contract with their signing keys, and only then are they legally bound by the 
terms of a specific document. After signing, the document can be sent over the 
encrypted link.</span></p>

<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Association of 
digital signatures and trusted time stamping</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Digital signature algorithms security protocols do not inherently do not provide 
certainty about the date and time at which the underlying document was signed. 
The signer might, or might not, have included a time stamp with the signature, 
or the document itself might have a date mentioned on it, but a later reader 
cannot be certain the signer did not, for instance, backdate the date or time of 
the signature. Such misuse can be made impracticable by using trusted time 
stamping in addition to digital signatures.</span></p>

<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Putting the 
private key on a smart card</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">All 
public key / private key cryptosystems depend entirely on keeping the private 
key secret. A private key can be stored on a user's computer, and protected by, 
for instance, a local password, but this has two disadvantages:</span></p>
<ul type="disc" lastCheckbox="null" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">the user can only sign documents on 
  that particular computer and </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">the security of the private key 
  completely depends on the&nbsp; of the computer, which is notoriously 
  unreliable for many PCs and operating systems. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">A more 
secure alternative is to store the private key on a smart card. Many smart cards 
are deliberately designed to be tamper resistant. In a typical implementation, 
the hash calculated from the document is sent to the smart card, whose CPU 
encrypts the hash using the stored private key of the user and returns it. 
Typically, a user must activate his smart card by entering a personal 
identification number or PIN code (thus providing a two-factor authentication). 
Note that it can be sensibly arranged (but is not always done) that the private 
key never leaves the smart card. If the smart card is stolen, the thief still 
needs the PIN code to be able to generate a digital signature. This reduces the 
security of the scheme to that of the PIN system, but is nevertheless more 
secure than are many PCs.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Using smart card 
readers with a separate keyboard</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">
Entering a PIN code to activate the smart card, commonly requires a numeric 
keypad. Some card readers have their own numeric keypad. This is safer than 
using a card reader integrated into a PC, and then entering the PIN using that 
computer's keyboard. The computer might be running a keystroke logger (by its 
owner/operators intention or otherwise -- due to a virus, for instance) so that 
the PIN code becomes compromised. Specialized card readers are less vulnerable, 
though not invulnerable, against tampering with their software or hardware. And, 
of course, eavesdropping attacks against all such equipment is of course 
possible.</span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify">
<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Other smart card 
designs</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial">Smart 
card design is an active field, and there are smart card schemes which are 
intended to avoid these particular problems, though so far with little security 
proofs.</span></p>
