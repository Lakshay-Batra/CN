ISO ETHERNET</span></font></p>
</b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Iso-Ethernet combines standard 10Mb/s 
Ethernet with 96B+D channels of standard ISDN on the same Category 3 
twisted-pair wiring already installed in most offices. It does this by recoding 
the data to allow 16Mb/s of data using the same 20MHz Ethernet clock. The 
additional data is time-multiplexed to allow the Ethernet and ISDN data to run 
concurrently without interference. This brings high-bandwidth telephony to the 
enterprise desktop at a low cost, enabling video conferencing and computer 
telephony integration applications.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Architecturally, Iso-Ethernet, also known 
as IEEE 802.9 [Minoli94] is a multiplexing of four separate channels of 
information: a 10 Mbps packet channel (P) with the IEE 802.3 CSMA/CD media 
access protocol, 6.144 Mbps of isochronous information organized in 96 B 
channels of 64 kbps each, one 64 kbps D-channel for signaling, and a 96 kbps 
M-channel for maintenance. Additionally framing is added to allow for 
synchronization with a wide area network. The complete data stream is modulated 
with 4B/5B coding. The total bandwidth is similar to that used in 10Base-T 
Ethernet so require similar cable technology and hardware to existing Ethernet 
systems. A typical network will consist of Iso-Ethernet terminals connected to 
LAN hubs. The hubs may be connected by a backbone network. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Iso-Ethernet combines the best properties 
of current IEE 802 LAN and ISDN networks. Multimedia applications requiring 
isochronous channels can use any combination of ISDN B channels for audio and 
video according to the desired quality requested. Wide area interfaces from 
synchronous data channels such as Megastream or SMDS can be connected to the Iso-Ethernet 
Hub. Narrow band basic rate ISDN and Primary rate ISDN can provide Wide Area 
connections using Q.931 signaling. ATM protocols can be added. The cost of Iso-Ethernet 
connections will be targeted to be competitive with existing high speed Ethernet 
cards.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">At least one video conferencing 
application developer has an interface in development for this type of LAN.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">As network managers struggle with the 
problems of providing multimedia applications such as videoconferencing, on 
today's networks, Isochronous Ethernet is emerging as the affordable, practical 
solution. Isochronous is a relatively new extension to the Ethernet standard 
that enhances a 10Base-T network with an additional bandwidth of 6.144 Mbps in 
the form of 96 ISDN B channels, thus permitting the network support voice, video 
and other time-sensitive data without congestion. The Isochronous Ethernet 
allows broadband networks to support real-time video, as well as data and voice, 
while enabling low-cost access to ATM backbones.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">This is not a new technology. The 
Isochronous standard was proposed years ago by National Semiconductor 
Corporation as part of a chip called isoENET. The technology has now been 
revived and is being finalized for acceptance by the IEEE 802.9A 
standards-setting committee. Iso-Ethernet involves a broadband architecture that 
includes a 10Base-T, 10-Mbps data channel plus 6.144 Mbps of bandwidth 
supporting 96 ISDN B channels. Channels can be used in multiple combinations of 
Nx64 kbps, supporting any video voice or other application. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Using this technology, an enterprise 
network can support multiple video applications along with its data and voice 
applications. Isochronous Ethernet can connect to the WAQN by adapting standard 
networking hubs or through a new generation of distributed PBXs which are being 
designed to deliver computer/telephony integration to the desktop. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Why Isochronous?<br>
</b>What occurs during conferencing over fully used packet Ethernets is that the 
network loading causes video frames to be dropped and some may be lost 
completely. This could take place in the Ethernet hub, the switch or router and 
this delay or disruption in the delivery of the frames could cause severe 
degradation in the transmitted voice/video quality. The frame rate can become so 
variable that words lose synchronization with the speaker's lips, making 
communication irritating and unacceptable. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The digital transmission of real-time 
voice and video requires a continuous or carefully timed bit stream so that 
sounds and images can be synchronized. Video must also travel without 
interruptions. Regular data &quot;packets&quot; on an Ethernet network can afford to be 
split into chunks or be retransmitted if they don't reach their designation on 
the first try. Therefore, applications such as videoconferencing naturally turn 
to isochronous transmission since it provides reliable performance in the face 
of minor delays in packet delivery.<b> </b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>The Iso-Ethernet-- How it Works </b>
<br>
Clearly, adding voice and video capabilities to the network is a tricky 
proposition; unless you have the right technologies. IsoENET is the only way to 
run multimedia applications on a single wiring plant without encountering a 
proprietary technology.Typical Ethernet traffic for file services, print 
services and client'/server application can be kept completely separate from the 
channels carrying voice, T.120 the data (application sharing), 
videoconferencing, graphical interfaces to the Internet, and any other ISDN 
applications.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The importance of ISDN as the basis for 
isochronous Ethernet lies in the fact that ISDN is the predominant network 
infrastructure that supports Application Sharing (T.120), videoconferencing 
(H.320) and voice (G.711)<br>
which are the standards set by the ITU-TSS to ensure interoperability among 
videoconferencing systems.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Added Bandwidth Capacity</b><br>
Isochronous Ethernet adds 6.144 Mbps of additional bandwidth to a 10Base-T 
network. The 6Mbps isochronous channel includes a D-channel for all setup and 
signaling. IBM established the call-setup procedure, the protocol which is based 
on the same setup and signaling protocol, Q.931, that ISDN, Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode (ATM), and Switched 56 lines use. The 6Mbps channel also supports 
up to 96 64Kbps B-channels (B for Bearer services). The 6Mbps channel uses the 
same clock speed and setup parameters as ATM. Because this channel is separate 
form the 10Mbps data channel, the isochronous traffic doesn't impact Ethernet 
performance.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The additional 6-Mbps channel will provide 
the equivalent of 96 ISDN B channels, each running at 64 Kbps. To put that kind 
of bandwidth in perspective, most high-end videoconferencing systems require six 
64-Kbps lines. The majority of group systems and desktop videoconferencing 
systems typically use two 64-Kbps lines. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">This means that an isochronous Ethernet 
network will be able to sustain between 15 and 40 videoconferencing sessions 
simultaneously depending on the quality desired by the users. The big advantage 
is isochronous Ethernet will support these sessions without putting any stress 
on the basic 10-Mbps pipe.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Multichannel Protocols</b><br>
Like ISDN, isochronous ethernet uses multichannel protocols and are based on 
time division multiplexing (TDM), a technique for multiplexing multiple channels 
over a single physical medium. TDM allocates to each channel a specific amount 
of time on the physical network wire. This is done independently of the other 
network protocols running on the same wiring, so existing LAN applications 
operate on isochronous Ethernet facilities unaffected by the isochronous 
traffic.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When an isoENET-equipped PC sends Ethernet 
data traffic, the data goes from the IsoHub/Switch to he Ethernet hub and is 
handled like all other Ethernet transmissions. When an iso-PC sends isochronous 
traffic, however, the isoHub/Switch sends that data to either a PBX or to a 
Time-division Multiplexer (TDM) via a T-1, E-1, or ISDN Primary Rate Interface 
(PRI) trunk and then out over the WAN.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Hubs and Adapters</b><br>
Isochronous Ethernet hubs and adapters will utilize two separate chip sets; the 
standard Ethernet chip set and a new isoENET chip set developed by National 
Semiconductor. Isochronous Ethernet sessions will be initiated<br>
through multimedia software applications. Access to the extra bandwidth will be 
transparent to users.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">An isochronous Ethernet hub or hub module 
will use switching to move the isochronous data portion of the data stream to 
isochronous data portion of the data stream to isochronous Ethernet clients or 
another ischronous<br>
Ethernet hub. These hubs will also handle regular Ethernet data in the same way 
a standard Ethernet hub would. This will allow isochronous Ethernet clients 
attached to this hub to run multimedia applications and exchange voice and 
video. Additionally, these clients will be able to access Ethernet resources and 
clients normally. Naturally, isochronous Ethernet clients will not be able to 
send isochronous data to unmodified Ethernet clients.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Connectivity Issues</b><br>
To extend isochronous Ethernet connections over the WAN, a multiplexer (which is 
used to pass multiple signals over a single line) or CSU/DSU (which provides 
connections to digital lines) establishes the connection to an ISDN, T1, or 
Switched 56 line. As with any WAN connection, the quality of video (or other 
multimedia data type) will depend on the amount of available bandwidth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">For example, if isochronous Ethernet's 
full; bandwidth. For example, if isochronous Ethernet's full bandwidth is 
available over 96 ISDN lines, there or four individuals could utilize a 
conferencing application with very good resolution and performance. If only two 
ISDN lines are used, the same users would see a drop in image size, resolution, 
and video refresh rate.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Since iso-Ethernet's data pipe is 
completely independent of the video and voice channels, contention will never be 
an issue. As a result real-time collaborative workgroups multimedia applications 
can be developed using<br>
ISDN as the transport mechanism. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>Three factors make the isochronous pipe 
a good interface to the ISDN network:</i></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">1. Call control procedures are 
  compatible with those of the international public phone network due to the 
  incorporation of existing ITU signaling in the already approved IEEE 802.9 
  master standard.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">2. Bandwidth within the isochronous 
  portion of isoEthernet is segmented into ISDN B channels which are exactly the 
  same as the B channels that are used throughput the global switched digital 
  network.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">3. The isoEthernet clock, at 8kHz, is 
  tightly synchronized to that used throughout the digital telephony industry.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>Cost Benefits</b><br>
One of the most appealing aspects of isochronous Ethernet is the case of 
integration and compatibility with 10Base-T networks. Users will be able to swap 
out their PC adapters and hub cards and replace them with isoENET cards. Prices 
for NIC and hub ports are expected to fall between $1,000-2,000 per seat. Thus, 
isoEthernet is a bit more expensive than Ethernet, but less expensive than ATM 
or switched Ethernet solutions.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">IsoEthernet can also operate over existing 
wiring such as unshielded twisted part (UTP). IsoEthernet glues together 
channels that handle isochronous and packet data separately and transports the 
two data types over existing Ethernet 10Base-T LANs that use Category 3 UTP or 
higher; thus avoiding rewiring costs. The addition of the 6.144 Mbps of 
bandwidth actually enables the same network to support both isochronous and 
asynchronous applications without overhauling the LAN infrastructure. ATM may be 
at the end of the rainbow when it comes to computer/telephony integration, but 
current pricing and availability are not very attractive yet.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><b>New Standards in Process<br>
</b>The IEEE 802.9 Integrated Services Local Area Networks Working Group has 
completed work on a 8023.9a draft document that creates a 16.384Mbps physical 
layer combining isochronous services with 802.3 MAC services on unshielded 
twisted-pair (UTP) Category 3 cable or higher. The draft, which has been 
approved by IEEE 802 voting members, includes specs for various signaling 
techniques and creates digital interfaces between private branch exchanges 
(PBX's) and LANs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Eventually, ATM will displace isoENET for 
many applications, such as video conferencing. In the meantime though, isoENET 
mates nicely with current network structures. Also, because isoEthernet depends 
on the same signaling system and operates at the same clock rate as those 
proposed for ATM, these broadband networks offer a seamless growth path to ATM, 
once that technology becomes more available and cost-effective.<b> </b></font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Sooner or later, networks will have to be 
upgraded to accommodate both voice and video. Several technologies, such as 
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), appear to promise help with this endeavor, but 
on closer look, they are either too expensive to implement, or require extensive 
network retooling. Isochronous Ethernet is the viable solution until ATM becomes 
the affordable and ubiquitous transport mechanism. IsoEthernet is interoperable 
with existing national international standards; it is a technology that requires 
very little retrofitting of existing LAN infrastructure and, perhaps most 
important, it is the only technology which keeps multimedia applications 
separate from the organization's existing LAN traffic.</font></p>
